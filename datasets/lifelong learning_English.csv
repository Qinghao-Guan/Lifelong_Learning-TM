Poorly funded institutions with weak curricula and little patient contact before graduation trained our earliest doctors. With the advent of the twentieth century, a reformation of medical education took place that created the foundation of our modem American medical education system. The importance of physician education increased, leading to the production of specialty boards and requirements for continuing medical education and culminating in a continuous certification process now required of all specialties including the American Board of Emergency Medicine. While the utility of continuing medical education has been questioned, technological advances, the Internet, and improved education techniques are helping physicians practice modem medicine in a time of rapidly expanding science.",2006,24,3,785,+

The article is structured around three main themes. First, it addresses the changing relationship between initial education, adult education and the general learning environments. As the author shows, these three elements form a complex and interacting web of influences, which can be fully understood only as a totality. Secondly, under the heading of ''The Dialectics at work behind and in education,'' the article discusses such factors as the changing patterns of employment and non-working time and the disparity between social demand for education and the institutional response. Thirdly, the author deals with the economy of lifelong learning and the changing role of the state in education. Overall, the author presents a picture of profound and widespread transition, in which many different types of learning society are emerging.",1994,40,3-5,353,381

Abandonment of formal education is met frequently among children from poor or disorganized families and these youngsters become usually subjects to be recruited by the organized crime. Costs for recovery and isolation are important and correlate to a significant budgetary effort. This article presents possible solutions: improving the public education and training to meet specific individual and collective security; development of a sustainable society; resumption of instruction, education and training for all individuals to stability and security of their families; mandatory recovery of those who have abandoned one of several forms of general education. Expectations are: elimination of illiteracy, reducing crime, building a prosperous society, ability to pay the foreign debts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Not just programme offerings and means of delivery will have to be restructured, but, more fundamentally, universities and colleges will have to rethink and reshape their business concept, that is: their way of creating value and maintaining their competitive edge over other providers in the education system. It will be argued that a business concept that is based on the idea of creating value through enhancing differentiation requires higher education providers to move as much as they can to a student-centered provision of education and training. This has far-reaching consequences for the curriculum, the concept of research, the interaction with students, and the relationships with other institutions in the education system.

In this context, the socio-political backgrounds, formation processes and contents of the periods in which the said reports were created were analysed in depth, and the effects of the reports on lifelong learning and the main criticisms of these reports were examined. These reports, which reflect the transformation of the concept from lifelong education to lifelong learning, are among the important studies that are considered as turning points in the field. This research is a descriptive study designed in the general survey model, which is one of the survey models. The reports in question are of importance beyond an ordinary report analysis due to the historical characteristics of the periods in which they emerged. For this reason, the synthesis of historical research and document analysis methods, as well as the scanning model, was used in the research. As a result of the research, it has been determined that the humanist and democratic content of the concept of lifelong education, which existed in the 1970s, gained an instrumental dimension in the 1990s to train the workforce needed by global capital. In this context, it is seen that the discourse of lifelong education, which is a public right, has evolved into the discourse of lifelong learning, which is shaped according to the demands of the market.",2022,,56,149,+

The aim of this paper is to highlight selected options of lifelong learning and its importance. Lifelong learning represents learning for personal, civic, social and professional purposes of the citizens. It consists of formal education that takes place in educational institutions, non-formal education that takes place in educational institutions outside the national education system and informal learning that takes place as a lifelong process of acquiring knowledge, skills and attitudes in everyday life without organizational interventions. Lifelong learning is the result of an increase in the need for investment in people and knowledge, it promotes the acquisition of basic skills, including digital literacy and increased opportunities for innovation. The current labour market puts very high requirements on a person, so it is necessary that throughout life he develops his knowledge, skills and abilities, and thus is able to adapt to new economic and social conditions. Lifelong learning involves educating citizens in pre-productive age, the basis of which is formed by education in the school system in schools and school facilities. Basic education followed by initial vocational education should provide young people with new skills that are needed in terms of the knowledge society. Lifelong learning also includes education in productive age, usually professional training, including education during unemployment and education in the post-productive age of life. The permeability of these relatively independent subsystems of lifelong learning enables citizens to start and finish learning at all ages of life, to choose the type and area of study and return to studying. The requirement of the current era is quick utilization of acquired knowledge and skills in career. Therefore, the emphasis is placed on the close link of the preparation of the training programs to employer companies in which the practical part of the training is conducted. Information society with the rapid development of new technologies, with a huge amount of information and information resources requires people who are going to be ready for such information environment - they will be competent and literate, they will have the knowledge and skills necessary for the 21st century. The new role of the school and its teachers for this time is to help students acquire and develop skills that will enable them to safely and effectively use the best technology options and enable them to fully integrate into the life of society. In the context of information literacy computer literacy is often mentioned as well, which we can consider the ability to use a computer. Computer literacy is actually a part of information literacy because working with new technologies and, of course, a computer is its essential part. This fact is also recognised by seniors, who are very interested in studying at the university of the third age in the field of computer and information society, where the author of the paper has led the teaching process for several years already",2017,,,1197,1204

Lifelong learning spans across all learning activities in all aspects of life and is not limited to general and vocational formal and non-formal education.

The importance of the on-going education of elderly people was also noted by UNESCO, for which the Institute for Lifelong Learning functions. It is necessary for education in the Russian Federation to also meet these world standards. The national education system for the elderly is the subject of potential improvement and modernisation. The program of Active longevity offers different opportunities for elderly learners and it promotes active and healthy aging. The world of education responds to the needs of our societies and helps our people to have an opportunity to achieve knowledge so as to be able to continue to partake in our ever more technological society. The aim of this article was to discover ways to promote lifelong education for our more senior people allowing them a continuing active lifestyle and healthy aging. Engaging seniors into education helps to equip them with the skills and value-added knowledge, whilst retaining their accumulated wisdom to remain available for following generations. This course of the English language was set up in K.G. Razumovsky Moscow state university of technologies and management in the autumn of 2017 and more than 70 elderly people took part. Two groups of elderly learners were offered a pilot course in the English language that they attended twice a week during the 2017/2018 academic year. Statistical characteristics of these learners were collected about their age, gender, general level of education, previous level of mastering English and motives for joining the study group. This pre-survey was conducted in the form of questionnaires at the beginning of the study to find out the spheres of interests and the preferences in the models of interaction. The post-programme survey was conducted at the end of the course to learn about their attitude(s) to the course and any difficulties that could have appeared during the programme of study. The results revealed a high level of motivation among these elderly people to learn. These senior learners now plan to find a new job and use their new knowledge of English for travelling. Speaking was the most problematic area in the education of the learners; the introductory course of Phonetics could be desirable for senior learners. The most preferable form of educational interaction was working in pairs; this allowed them to communicate and solve educational tasks together. One of the main outcomes from this programme was an identified need for tailor-made courses in English specifically targeted at our more senior members of society whom, perhaps, have been out of an educational environment for many years.",2018,,,3926,3934

This paper adds to this domain of discussion with a critical discourse analysis of Chinese lifelong education/learning policies. It finds that lifelong education and life learning have been positioned pragmatically to support the country's modernist project of development, which culminates in the proclamation to shift from made in China, i.e., a manufacture-based economy, to created in China, i.e., a knowledge-based economy. Within this overall picture, the Marxist socialist and collective ideology has been made the hegemony in the promotion of lifelong education/learning practices. Western humanism and Confucian humanism have also had sketchy presence in the documents examined, although they are not necessarily invoked together with their original ideological connotations. The study also shows that given their directive genre, these policies have served to designate multiple actors to turn lifelong education and learning into practice and promote socialist lifelong learners as the ideal learning subjects; both mechanisms are implicated in entrenching existing governmental power structure.",2017,18,2,189,201

A system of adult education was established in the 1950s, but that was to complement the formal education system as an instrument to implement state manpower planning. Lifelong education as a modem notion was introduced to China only at the end of the 1970s immediately after the Cultural Revolution. The notion did not gain much ground when education was closely associated with state manpower plans, and individuals did not have much room for personal development. The break away from strict manpower planning in the early 1980s has given rise to individual aspirations for education. Such aspirations have integrated with the long tradition of self-motivation in learning and have given rise to spectacular expansion in all kinds of adult education. While the motives for such learning are still very much related to jobs and incomes, alternative objectives for learning are fast developing outside the formal sectors of education.

The presence of lifelong education is caused by the emergence of learning and educational needs that continue to grow and develop throughout the flow of human life. Lifelong education focused on the motivation of a person or group to gain learning experiences in a sustainable manner. The learning experience is taken consciously, programmatically, and systematically through the process of learning in order to achieve the learning objectives that have been determined. The function of lifelong education is as a force for motivating learners so that they can perform learning activities based on the encouragement and direction of itself in a way of thinking and doing in the world and life. The implementation of lifelong education in a family indicates that family education is one vehicle that can be taken by a person from the cradle to the end of life. Family is the first and major educational institution where a child receives the first education can shape the personality for times to come. Through the family, the parents and family members prepare everything needed by every family member of the family, which can be done through guidance, solicitation, modelling.

This has led to LLE taking similar pathways across many countries, i.e., away from a focus on personal and cultural betterment, to one associated with promoting individual employability. However, policies and practices in Japan offers a nuanced contrast to the general trend. That is, the overall focus on LLE, particularly for older Japanese is premised on social engagement, personal enrichment and often captured in 'social education'. There is also a focus on sustaining the adult employability, including the re-employment of retirees, in structured ways and tailored to meet their needs and enacted at the local level. This paper reviews the manifestations of LLE in Japan to examine how its goals and educational provisions are being developed, enacted, engaged with and evaluated. Overall, it is suggested that Japan has not wholly embraced the tight economic focus on promoting and supporting LLE associated with employability imperatives. Perhaps through the electoral power of the aged population, the provision of educational experiences is focused on longevity, cultural betterment, further education and reducing the social isolation of older Japanese.",2022,62,1,31,55

Promoting lifelong learning as continuous, collaborative, self-directed, active, broad in domain, everlasting, positive and fulfilling, and applicable to one's profession as well as all aspects of one's life has emerged as a major global educational challenge. Meeting this challenge will require changes in the way teachers teach and learners learn, as teachers take on a more facilitative role and learners take more responsibility for setting goals, identifying resources for learning, and reflecting on and evaluating their learning. For physicians, this will require less dependence on traditional educational venues, such as passive continuing medical education activities, and greater participation in self-assessment, peer assessment, evaluation of performance in practice, documentation of practice-based learning and improvement activities, and learning at the point of care. Radiologists in an academic setting are exposed to multiple opportunities for practicing lifelong learning, such as teaching others, participating in multidisciplinary conferences and journal clubs, and engaging in research. All radiologists can participate in self-audits and group audits of performance and become active participants in national radiology societies, where they can learn from each other. Participation in the American Board of Radiology's Maintenance of Certification program reflects a commitment to actively engage in lifelong learning and is one way of demonstrating to the general public a commitment to maintaining competence.

One of the challenges facing educators is the development of curriculum which facilitates the acquisition of these generic skills in learners. Of equal importance is to explicitly include these generic skills in course content, objectives and the expected learning outcomes.

However, physicians' computer skills do not always keep up with technology, nor do they take advantage of online search and continuing education services. This article describes the rationale for using electronic databases and training, as well as basic computer skills, computer equipment, and important online resources for psychiatrists to meet their continuing education and recertification needs quickly, easily, and conveniently. Method: A literature review was performed using PUBMED and Google to find articles related to recertification, physician's technology adoption and computer skills, evidence-based medicine, and basic approaches to lifelong learning using computers and the Internet, and resources for lifelong learning. Results: Psychiatrists are required to master a discrete set of information for board certification, and to maintain that knowledge for recertification. Surveys have shown that although most physicians use computers, the majority use them for personal or business purposes, and not for accessing Continuing Medical Education (CME) programs (1). The Council on Graduate Medical Education requires the acquisition of medical informatics skills for the Undergraduate Medical Education for the 21st Century (UME-21) curriculum project (2). There is a growing body of literature outlining basic computer skills and competencies for physicians to access online textbooks, databases, journals, and CME programs.

In the paper, the authors demonstrate the influence of the education and educational level of social workers on the quality of social work as a profession that helps people in unfavorable situation. They point to the importance of lifelong learning, which is essential for advancing the knowledge and competences of social workers in practice. Concept. Lifelong education for social workers is currently a necessity for their functioning not only on the basis of the rapid, dynamic changes in their problems and social clients, but also for rapid and dynamic changes in the use of methods and techniques of social work. Method. The study deals with the educational development of employees in the profession of social worker. It defines and identifies forms of continuous education of social workers, which can have different methods and which can result in different competencies of a social worker. Results. The study confirms that the lifelong learning of social workers requires constant access to support and information about education, but also to set opportunities and thus facilitate access to the education of social workers. It is necessary to realise that the competences of the social worker must be in accordance with the education that the social worker has. Conclusion. The scientific articles and contributions that we offer in this study point to lifelong learning, which has the effect of expanding the possibilities of a social worker's work with several types of clients, increases his competences and thus acquires a lot of knowledge and skills that are subsequently applied in practice.",2022,13,2,359,368

In essence, formal lifelong learning is activities that take place in formal educational institutions that leads to some form of accreditation or qualification. Formal learning is hierarchically structured, chronologically graded educational system and moving from primary school level through the university. In addition to general academic studies, a variety of specialized programs and institutions for full-time technical and professional training are provided to employees. In this context, higher learning educational institutions play an important responsibility to provide the programs and courses to the employees to upgrade their skills and change to high level of education. In essence, organization belief lifelong learning is the organizational learning process which apparently contributes to produce and develop high quality of workforce such as a knowledge worker, dynamic competitiveness and aim to achieve high performance work practices (HPWS). Thus, the importance of formal lifelong learning in organizational context, is to improve employees career future development, enhances social inclusion, active citizenship, personal development, and competitiveness. However, the issues that need to address in discussion of formal lifelong learning is the lack of awareness of formal lifelong learning education and less self learning motivation for employees to embark on formal lifelong learning. Those issues consequently reduce the participation and interest of employees to continue their study. To overcome these challenges, employers and employees required to educate the concepts and consequences of pursuing informal lifelong learning education. Therefore, the objective of this study is to understand the critical factors of formal lifelong learning education that encourages employees to further their study. The discussion was concentrated on the motivational factors such as intrinsic, extrinsic and self determination theory that influences the employee self-motivated learning. The discussion will contribute to the additional knowledge of lifelong learning and be applied to design the strategies in organization to retain and influence the employees in pursuit of formal lifelong learning education.",2014,,,5304,5311
J,"Black, S",,,"Black, Sara",,Lifelong learning as cruel optimism: Considering the discourses of lifelong learning and techno-solutionism in South African education,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF EDUCATION,,"This article seeks to examine how two discourses -of lifelong learning and techno-solutionism - tangle with each other in South African education policy imaginaries, particularly the latter discourse as a response to an (arguably manufactured) frame of crisis. The author suggests that the discourse of lifelong learning constructs a relation of what Lauren Berlant terms cruel optimism for the marginalised majority of South Africans, sustaining a fantasy of liberatory education despite empirical evidence to the contrary. First, the prevalence of this discourse in key policy texts (predominantly education policy white papers) is examined, along with how both instrumentalist and humanist framings of lifelong learning promote and sustain this relation in spite of the ordinariness of the attrition of the subject (in Berlant's terms) as a defining experience of everyday life. Next, the ubiquitous frame of crisis in education analysis in South Africa is considered, along with techno-solutionism (a term coined by Evgeny Morozov in 2013) as a popular response amongst the dominant middle-class minority. The article suggests that cruel optimism is sustained for this middle-class group through techno-solutionist education utopias, as what Berlant terms a redefinitional strategy for manufacturing ahistorical moments of agency in the face of persistent structural issues centuries in the making. The lens of cruel optimism is thus offered as a mechanism for denaturalising the political work of both discourses, a necessary (albeit insufficient) move towards better grasping the nature of South African education concerns, as well as theories of change that might offer genuinely emancipatory learning for all.",2022,68,5,673,689

What are the implications of a public policy of lifelong learning for senior citizens? What are the lifelong learning needs of seniors, who should provide the opportunities for learning, and what principles of learning should guide such opportunities? An empowerment model for assessing need and developing a lifelong learning program in the context of a seniors center is presented. On the basis of the philosophy of research as emancipatory education (Lather, 1991), a program was designed to train seniors as research associates and assist them in conducting a needs assessment of their peers. The focus of the program was on principles of (a) research, (b) program development, and (c) pedagogy designed to empower seniors as leaders in building a healthy learning community in the process of gathering information about the needs of the seniors in their community and where and how to serve them. Results of the program evaluation support the benefits of learning to these seniors' mental, physical, and social health and the effectiveness of the program in developing lifelong learning skills and attitudes, with significant increases found in level of self-esteem, ability to express ideas, and the feeling of being heard. Implications include the need to promote lifelong learning as a way of life for all seniors and to recognize the seniors center as a natural public forum for education.",1995,21,4,305,320

However, the disenchantment of the world makes aesthetics a need to be continuously defined in the present age. The narrow and one-sided nature of traditional aesthetics has become increasingly apparent, and it is difficult for the ideals of beauty and art to provide reliable support for the development of aesthetics. In the late 1980s, perceptual knowledge became a frequently discussed and meaningful keyword in aesthetics research and education. Creativity comes from perceptual knowledge. Creativity is based on popular art training and aesthetic education. Creative thinking should be achieved through the process of diversification to form an area with multi-faceted and abstract structure. Because art has an essential quality (Timbre), I proposed a visual art and aesthetics project based on the implementation of artistic objectives in the teaching of visual arts and the aesthetic encounter of politics, society, history, culture and the environment. The experimental programme was performed at National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts. The results of the research confirmed that implementation of aesthetic perception education can have a positive impact on students' views of art and on the overall popularity of related learning. Examples of education in aesthetic experience and aesthetic perception can be used as guidelines for the implementation of art and multicultural education.

A lifelong learning environment is one that would fit the needs of an education defined as such. The focus is on, learning to learn continuously and the ability to keep learning throughout a lifetime, supporting creativity, confidence, and initiative in a holistic way. A lifelong learning culture would ideally be equally available to everyone, become the norm for a large part of the population. The behavior setting of the learning environment does not teach directly, however, it can facilitate or hinder learning directly and symbolically. The effects of the physical setting on learning are not universal, but are moderated by the social and educational context. No single learning setting is best, as material, goals, and all users have to be considered. Although it is often neglected, learning is maximized when the physical setting is considered. Environments designed for lifelong learning, are an essential element that provide not only a background for learning, but act as a resource and an active participant in learning. In this study, the interdisciplinary nature of interior design education is discussed. The lifelong learning approach that needs to be a part of the profession of interior design, interdisciplinarity, and the significance of adaptive reuse provided in the first years of interior design education is believed to equip students with the necessary skills to be competent in their profession. The interior design project of a lifelong learning environment that is given to the second year Interior Architecture and Environmental Design students at Izmir University of Economics is presented in this paper as an example. In this project, students were asked to understand the idea of lifelong learning, select a theme and target group for the education to be given in the particular space, and complete the interior design according to the unifying interior concept. The building was chosen as the Women's Producers Bazaar in Urla, Izmir, Turkey. This was a building that had multiple uses in the past, and was appropriate for this project in that, it already had a similar purpose belonging to the municipality and being used as a community center in which a variety of activities took place. The high ceiling enabled using the volume of the space more generously, enabling creative mezzanine floors and other three-dimensional manipulations in the space. The students also learned about adaptive reuse of a historical building with specialists from this area.

While previous research focused mainly on returns on formal education in schools or universities, there has been a notable shift in recent years towards the analysis of returns on adult learning. While research has established theory-driven empirical evidence concerning labour market-related outcomes, it fails to identify and coherently explain non-monetary outcomes. The authors of this article review 13 empirical studies on different forms of civic participation as a return on engagement in adult learning. Individuals' civic participation is one precondition to social cohesion and functioning citizenship at a societal level and thus a factor of high political and societal relevance. All the studies reviewed in this article suggest a positive association between adult learning and civic engagement. To what extent this association is causal, however, remains an open question. The authors argue that any efforts to identify such causality must begin with a number of theoretical assumptions about the mechanisms through which learning may influence civic participation.

It was a joint national project, realized from 2008 until 2011. The project participants were all state universities in Serbia as well as universities from the European Union with great experience in the field of lifelong learning. The Ministry of Education, the National Council for Higher Education, the National Employment Service, the Serbian Employers' Association and the Municipality of Kragujevac were the support of all the project activities, since they enhance the cooperation between partners from the education, government and business sectors. The project tackled a variety of tasks and resulted in numerous outcomes. However, this paper reflects on some of these outcomes addressing the initial way of organizing University LLL centres, linking the established centres in a national network of universities' LLL centres, and connecting the national to the international networks. After the establishment of University LLL centres at state universities in Serbia, strategic goals were identified for the establishment of the national University LLL network. During the formation of this network, numerous dilemmas were identified: Would the national network be more efficient as an informal or formal network? What would be the mission of this network? What would be the aims of the network? How could the University LLL network be funded?

Examples of international intergenerational programs focused on lifelong learning and education in countries as different as Germany, India, Spain, United Kingdom, Uruguay, and U.S. are presented as pathways to combat the following three main threats to sustainable societies: cultural discontinuity, lack of trust, and the increasing challenges to living in diverse contexts. Special attention is paid to the move from multi-generational learning and education contexts to intended intergenerational endeavors at all levels. Purposeful efforts are made to facilitate interaction between generations to enhance learning and education. The traditional paradox in evidence is that most of our school systems consist of age-segregated classrooms while a community of teachers, families and students from different generations are living side by side. This phenomenon is highlighted. In order to illustrate how this paradox may be solved, we present a few cases of international intergenerational initiatives carried out in educational settings where generations meet purposefully to teach and learn together across the lifespan.",2017,,,87,107
J,"Collins, J",,,"Collins, J",,Education techniques for lifelong learning - principles of adult learning,RADIOGRAPHICS,,"The adult education literature supports the idea that teaching adults should be approached in a different way than teaching children and adolescents (preadults). Many aspects of effective teaching apply to all age groups. However, adults have had more life experiences and in many ways are differently motivated than children. Adults are more self-directed in their learning and have a greater need to know why they should learn something. Self-initiated learning is the most lasting and pervasive. Learning should be applicable to the learner's work or to other responsibilities valued by the learner. Thus, it is important that the instructor know the learner's needs and design learning activities that are relevant to those needs. The learner should be actively involved in learning, with the instructor acting as a facilitator. The instructor should recognize that adults have different learning styles and should tailor instruction to the characteristic ways adults prefer to learn. Understanding the principles of adult learning can help teachers become better facilitators of learning.",2004,24,5,1483,1489

Since learning is embedded in human nature, various forms of the concept emerged simultaneously in different countries where they developed individually, thus creating a multi-faceted concept that was recently brought in the spotlight of the scientific arena. The purpose of this paper is to bring to the attention the 'facets' of the lifelong learning concept, its evolution over the years and the ways it is recognized to help the achievement of the knowledge economy. The exploration of the features of the knowledge economy with far-ranging implications for education and training, the challenges raised by the knowledge economy for education and training systems, and the emergence of the lifelong learning concept aiming to equip learners with the skills and competencies they need to succeed in a knowledge economy is done thorough a theoretical research based on an extensive literature review to allow for a clear understanding of the concepts of knowledge economy and lifelong learning, and of their interlinks. In Romania, the concept of lifelong learning as such is quite new. Some aspects, like adult continuous education and professional training as well as the apprenticeship at workplace were offered extensive attention, but an integrative vision on lifelong learning was not transposed into legislation and practice, until recently. The paper offers a review of the measures taken for the development of the lifelong learning system in Romania.

Now, more career-switchers and career-upgraders who are joining universities for further training are becoming the major group of adult learners. This current situation requires formal education in courses with controlled output. Hence, lifelong learning is seen as a necessity and an opportunity for these adult learners. One characteristic of adult education is that the learners tend to bring with them life experience from their past, especially when learning mathematics. Most of them associate mathematics with the school subjects and unable to recognize the mathematics in their daily practice as mathematics. They normally place a high value on learning mathematics because of its prominent role in their prospective careers, but their learning often requires overcoming personal experience and motivating themselves to learn mathematics again.

We describe examples of lifelong learners using social media in medical education and healthcare that have been reported in the peer-reviewed literature. Medical or other health professions students may have qualities consistent with being a lifelong learner, yet once individuals move beyond structured learning environments they will need to recognize their own gaps in knowledge and skills over time and be motivated to fill them, thereby incorporating lifelong learning principles into their day-to-day practice. Engagement with social media can parallel engagement in the learning process over time, to the extent that online social networking fosters feedback and collaboration.

In the past, professional education lasted for a lifetime through all the industrial revolutions, including the third. During those revolutions, not only the pace of knowledge doubling has accelerated from a lifetime to months, but the halflife of pertinent knowledge has also shortened. Are we capable of adjusting to that pace? How can we learn all that is needed in the old Prussian model of education based on one-program-fits-all? Since professionals have to migrate through multiple job environments, we should revamp the educational system at the core. The new system must be personalized to match the diversity of individual abilities and styles of learning. The new system must also be based not only on the traditional body of knowledge (BoK), but also on the body of experience (BoX) and body of memetics (BoM). The new personalized system of learning must be sufficiently agile and interactive so that it would become evolving in its symbiosis with humans. For that to happen, we should consider coexisting with memetic symbiotic autonomous cognitive systems, specifically involving digital twins. This paper addresses some aspects of this view.",2021,,,,

Lifelong learning is measured as the combined knowledge acquired during the primary, secondary and tertiary levels of education. Foreign aid dynamics include total aid, aid from multilateral donors (MD) and aid from the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) countries. The empirical evidence is based on an endogeneity-robust generalized method of moments. The following findings are established. First, the aid variables have positive effects on primary school enrolment and lifelong learning, with the exception of aid from MD which positively affects only lifelong learning. Second, the positive effect on primary school enrolment consistently has a higher magnitude compared to the corresponding impact on lifelong learning. Third, the effects of aid dynamics on secondary and tertiary school enrolments are not significant.

Two key reasons why adults are seeking additional education are the need for further education is immediate skills training and career advancement. Along with these reasons, more adult learners are looking at the long-term investment and whether or not their additional education and training will help them during their lifelong endeavors. Consequently, can these additional learning events help them over the period of their lifetime and perhaps help them to continue with lifelong learning? Knowles (1980) noted that adult [learners] see education as a process of developing increased competence to achieve their full potential in life. They want to be able to apply whatever knowledge and skill they gain today to life more effective tomorrow. Thus, this raises the question of whether our educational institutions are offering enough learning opportunities to help satisfy the needs of the adult learner, as well as meeting the growing workforce needs of society's business needs. Further, are adults returning back to education in order to meet short-term versus long-term needs and wants? This paper will examine how one virtual university has addressed the learning needs of today's working adults, provided additional skills training for workforce needs, and enable adult learners with skills and training to prepare for lifelong learning events and career plans. While many universities focus on meeting the intended learning needs, some schools focus on the current learning objectives and addressing future skills training and educational needs of their adult learners. One way virtual universities can address both areas is by developing learning applications that address current learning objectives, but also focus on learning activities that can link classroom learning to real world applications.",2012,,,5618,5624

At present, the easily access to information and communication technologies represents one of the premises of good functioning in modern society. Cyberspace is characterized by lack of borders, dynamism and anonymity, generating both opportunities for the development of the information society based on knowledge and, unfortunately risks to its functioning (individual, state and even cross-border). Romania assumes both the development of dynamic informational environment based on interoperability and specific information society services and the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens alongside with national security interests within legal framework. From this point of view, it is mandatory to develop the cybersecurity culture of ICT (Information and Communication Technology) systems for users who have limited information about cybersecurity risks and cyberdefence solutions. Vast knowledge both of cyberspace threats and risks and prevention and defense of these requires a good communication and cooperation among special actors of this field. In this context, ensuring cybersecurity is a joint responsibility. End users play a crucial role in ensuring the security of networks and information systems: they need to be made aware of the risks they face online and be empowered to take simple steps to guard against them. The lifelong learning (LLL) is the continuous process of flexible learning opportunities, correlating the acquired competencies and education in formal institutions with developing the informal and non-formal competencies, especially at the workplace. This reflects a concept of continuous learning anytime, anywhere. Also, the concept has under gone a serious of changes, the fundamental reasoning stays the same: people must update their knowledge and their competencies in their quality as individuals, citizens and employees. This is essential in an attempt to support competitively within global economy of knowledge based technology and in order to promote social integration as well as the participation in democratic society. Therefore, LLL includes, in a broader sense, all forms of learning (i.e.) formal education, non-formal education and informal education.

Indeed, it is one of the leading factors that affect current teaching methodology. Overall, it can be said that the development of the Internet and mobile devices has created new opportunities for teaching and learning, not only using traditional media and websites, but also by providing various web and mobile applications. One possibility raised by applying this technology is that universities may offer flexible forms of education as full-time or part-time study with the need of students making a physical appearance only in the final or diploma exams, regardless of the level of studies. Distance learning is especially attractive when there is a problem with regular classes' attendance or there is a need to relocate during studies, as students can decide when and how much time they devote to learning through Internet classes. This is also an ideal offer for professionally active people who want to expand their qualifications. Moreover, the cost of online studies is lower than traditional studies. However, this learning method requires a lot of self-discipline and organizational skills. The results show that the teaching and learning processes can be improved by e-learning systems. Of note, this approach is well accepted by students. The main purpose of this research is to make the reader aware of e-learning technologies in education, as well as to characterize two postgraduate study offers available in Poland's universities: Web and Mobile Applications (Computer Science) and Geographical Information Systems (Earth Science). Both studies are taught online (through the web), using educational platforms as the way to exchange knowledge.

However, the STEM pipeline carries implicit assumptions regarding length (i.e. that it starts and stops at specific stages in one's education or career), contents (i.e. that some occupational fields are in the pipeline while others are not), and perceived purpose (i.e. that leakage, or leaving STEM, constitutes failure). Using the National Survey of College Graduates, we empirically measure each of these dimensions. First, we show that a majority of STEM workers report skills training throughout their careers, suggesting no clear demarcation between education and work. Second, we show that using on-the-job expertise requirements (rather than occupational titles) paints a very different portrait of the STEM workforce-and persistence in it (where substantial attrition remains evident, especially among women and African Americans). Third, we show that STEM-educated workers are well-prepared for but dissatisfied with non-STEM jobs, complicating our understanding of leaving.

The workshop includes presentations on lifelong learning competencies and specific recommendations for engineers, as well as an active learning exercise that helps students demonstrate their lifelong learning competence developed throughout their undergraduate career. Our mixed-methods evaluation reveals that the students improve their awareness of the importance of LLL at an important time in their lives as they finish their undergraduate academic career and move to the global labor market.

This paper argues the thesis that lifelong learning is adopted as the frame, concept, and learning philosophy, but adult education, within the field of practice and as an inherent part of the implementation of this concept, is highly neglected. The fact that adult education has also disappeared from other major international documents and programs influences not only the achievements of the educational goals, but jeopardizes the implementation of all other SDGs. A various aspects of the relations between adult education and sustainable development are analyzed in this paper. The argument is that sustainable development on the local, national, and global level is not possible without acknowledging the intersectoral character of adult education.

The analysis of being is captured by the language of dynamic movement, which grants no priority to one's thought, action, or feeling, none of whose operations can be understood without reference to the other.

The findings suggest that although more elements were found at Midlands University than Nam Du University, assessment in both cases was an imperfect realisation of this framework.

The Education is an instrument for social change in our globalized world; learning is considered an essential component for the individual and collectives development as it promotes the required characteristics in the globalized world and neoliberalism (Krishna & Srilatha, 2015). This must be considered from early childhood to the end of life, especially at the university as a specialized context for lifelong learning. The relevance of Lifelong Learning and its full incorporation to Higher Education has arisen in the Bologna Declaration in 1999 and has been addressed in the different biennial meetings of Ministers responsible for Higher Education in the European Union. In this context, Lifelong Learning was included in the Strategy document 2015. The development of Lifelong Learning is closely related to the social function of the University as it seeks to promote independent learning, professional and occupational development and, therefore, improving employability, from the base of adult education. Each adult learner has their individual learning needs and we need theories of adult learning as andragogy (UNESCO, 1985). Malcolm Knowles Andragogical theory of adult learning clearly brings out the distinction between the adult and child learner since it is based on the distinctive and unique characteristics of adult as a learner (Kapur, 2015). According to Knowles (1984), the practitioner and theorist of adult education, the `adult learning principles' that should be applied while teaching/training adults are: learner's need to know, self-concept of the learner, prior experience of the learner, readiness to learn, orientation to learning and motivation to learn. The aim of this study is both to analyze the basic characteristics of the adult learner highlighted by Knowles as regards as learning throughout life and to check their differences according with the certified training level, presuming that the formal school system as a whole has this as a mission, and according to the situation of the individual employment/unemployment, both as indicators of employability. We measure the self-esteem, intellectual openness, autonomy, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation in a heterogeneous sample of Workers= 74; Unemployed= 182; Formal education= 69; VET and Bachelor= 65; University students= 120. Results show that levels of all the variables analyzed are not as high as it is desiderable and expected in adulthood. Along with this, it seems that formal education systems tent to promote higher levels of self-concept and intrinsic motivation. On the other hand, it seems that unemployment decreases the levels of self-concept; the intrinsic motivation seems to differentiate between college students and workers with job security from unemployed; and extrinsic motivation differentiates workers with job security from the college students and unemployed. These results are relevant for organization of the education system because they allow us to investigate the alignment of education and the labour market in order to maturation and autonomy and to eliminate problems of society as social exclusion, unemployment, etc. We urge stakeholders to think of the ways through which reality is interpreted if we are to be fully aware of how this process influences education planning.",2016,,,4264,4269

The dominant view that the economic and social returns to public investment in adult learning are too low to warrant large-scale public funding has been challenged by recent LLAKES research that shows significant returns to participants in lifelong learning with improvements in both their employability and employment prospects. It is argued that, under conditions of growing social polarisation and economic uncertainty, lifelong learning can have a significant protective effect by keeping adults close to a changing labour market. In this paper we review research from different disciplinary and epistemological traditions, providing evidence of the beneficial effects of lifelong learning, especially when taking into account the dynamics of the life course. Transitions and turning-points in youth and in adult life are markers of diversification of the life course; how far these diversifications amount to de-standardisation' of the life course is debated. They involve biographical negotiation, in which any decision is consequential upon previous decisions and involves the exercise of contextualised preferences as well as the calculations of rational choice'. Gaining a better understanding of how changing demands are negotiated at different life stages offers a new perspective, moving from narrow versions of rational choice theory towards models of biographical negotiation as promising avenues for effective policy-making.",2013,61,1,25,47

The first is being active learners enrolled in all different activities related to Active Learning [1] that have place at academic space. The second demand is to keep their knowledge and skills up-to-date. But continuously updating and learning is not just a student attitude. Nowadays, lifelong learning [2] and continuous training is the key to satisfy our changing professional needs. We believe that people need help from the higher education institutions in their lifelong learning process. Higher education institutions are very capable to manage an effective, trustworthy and accurate strategy for lifelong learning. We must ensure that our education and training systems are able to provide students with new competences and skills for living standards in Europe: The aim is for everyone to have the key set of competences needed for personal development, social inclusion, active citizenship and employment. These competences, apart from specific for each field of study, include more transversal skills such as digital competence, entrepreneurship competence, critical thinking, problem solving and learning to learn [3]. All citizens have the right to high-quality and inclusive education, training and lifelong learning. Higher education institutions should support this right with high quality and accurate sources of information. Therefore, students should not only be self-updated making an online course from time to time; they must be continuously connected to the source of academic and scientific advances in their field of interest. We think this support can only be provided by higher education institutions. Higher education institutions should manage this process since they have the knowledge, the infrastructure and, more importantly, they have the ideal human resources to accomplish the process: teachers. In this work we propose a framework in which the universities are more involved in the lifelong learning process of graduates. We currently have the technology needed to easily develop online platforms that could implement this new theory. It would also be interesting to incorporate knowledge from the business and industrial sector so experts from different fields can collaborate in a social network. We propose as a first experiment the development of a social collaborative content filter. Students and graduates have access to a massive and overwhelming amount of information with no quality or classification filters that makes it unhelpful. Besides, the digital origins of most of this information makes many people without computer self-efficacy [4] unable to take advantage of it. Our proposal will facilitate the collaborative supervision of the sources of information to ensure its quality and educational purpose by experts. Students and graduates will also actively participate in their learning process interacting with the proposed system.",2019,,,8744,8749

The last two forms of education are the acquisition of knowledge, skills and abilities for comprehensive development and qualification development of a person, the formation of a civic position and the motivation for self-development and self-education, which is not necessarily accompanied by officially recognized documents but has no less value. This leads to the formation of a new system of learning that will operate throughout the life of a person and should become one of the strategic objectives for any state that strives for sustainable development. Such changes require an innovative approach at all stages of the new system formation, including its financial support. However, due to objective reasons for the limited budget funds, the state cannot independently provide financing for the lifelong learning system without involving additional economic entities. Thus, this article is devoted to building expenditure optimization model as the main innovation in the financing of the lifelong learning system. For this purpose, the authors define the stage of formation, the essence and basic characteristics of the lifelong learning system in the modern world. The next step was a providing of a comparative analysis of the main trends in financing education in the countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and their partners and Ukraine at the expense of various sources (public and private) and for different levels of education (primary education, secondary education, postgraduate education, elementary education higher education, higher education). On the results of analysing the absence of structured information about extra-budgetary funding of lifelong learning system is indicated. Thus, authors developed the approach to estimating potential volume of extra-budgetary sources of funding for a lifelong education system by using structured equation modelling method, where the informational basis are education expenditures of the Consolidated Budget of Ukraine and the Education Index (as a component of the Human Development Index). For calculations software, STATISTICA 6.1 was used.

The new approach combines critical thinking with experiential learning in a common framework able to facilitate entrepreneurship education for various heterogeneous populations through lifelong learning or vocational training. The proposed approach utilizes critical instruction embedded in experiential learning as to resolve possible disorientation of learners during the common experiential/reflective instruction for entrepreneurship. A critical-thinking-deviation from Kolb's experiential learning model is introduced and preliminarily tested empirically for two different groups of adult learners. Suggested conceptualization through critical instruction is expected either to resolve disorienting situations or to lead to postponement of courses and reconsideration of the theoretical framework. The latter is due to the emancipatory nature of critical instruction and depends on both learners' intrinsic needs, assumptions and on the specific framework under which entrepreneurship education is promoted. Empirical evidence for the dual consequence, due to the adoption of critical instruction, is illustrated for the two groups of learners. The theoretical scope of the paper concerns the appropriateness and the consistency of the suggested critical-experiential teaching for entrepreneurship designed for adult learners. Implications concern entrepreneurship curricula, innovative instruction and trainers' training. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2015,6,,87,97

The diversity of initial training, the different levels of qualifications of professors and supervisors, the rapid development of technology in the field of work, are just some of the many causes that continuous training requires. A study carried out on a representative sample highlighted the specific aspects of the process of continuous training of those involved in the achievement of vocational education. There is a different motivation and attitude towards continuous training in general and contents. A major influence of the directive management and a decrease of the level of teachers' own initiative can be noticed: those who activate in institutions that are run by dynamic directors who are aware of the importance of continuous training of the teaching staff, are more involved in the process. We find a tendency of the employer's involvement in the continuous training of teachers in vocational education, who is interested in the quality of professional training of future employees and invest in the quality of education.

Consequently, their experience of the world through media supplants direct experience. Thus, it is necessary to prepare children very early for critical perception of information from the Internet. These tasks are realized by media education, which has developed at the end of the 20th century and currently it needs revitalization. Media education is defined within the wide scope of media functioning in the society. Similarly, researchers describe the need for developing media education by traditional social institutions: family, school, state, church, public benefit and non-governmental organizations. The problem is complex because nowadays media create more and more hermetic environment for people, and the world (which means reality) is perceived under the influence of the media. Media education has a dominant position also within the scope of lifelong learning and as with society it is also subject to continuous and rapid changes. Thus, media are a tool for creating lifelong educational space and fulfill many functions. They are as follows: 1 Cognitive and creative function, when use of media solves some problems. 2 Motivating and activating function, when use of media triggers activity concerning meeting cognitive needs. 3 Practicing function, when media enable children to perform some tasks and exercises that consolidates knowledge and information. 4 Control function, when work with media verifies knowledge and skills. 5 Educational function, when media create conditions affecting child's personality. 6 Therapeutic function, when media enable to reduce developmental disorders These six functions describe participation of children in media culture. At the same time, the specific nature of media impact on lifelong learning consists in changing the types of experiencing reality. Jerome Bruner and David Olson distinguish three ways how child experience reality through media: 1 Reconstructive mode - learning by action (e.g. direct perception). 2 Iconic mode - learning by observation of visual models (e.g. media presentation and narrations). 3 Symbolic mode - learning by symbolic systems (e.g. linguistic codes, iconic codes etc.). Along with the transition from direct experience, which is characteristic of early childhood, to indirect perception in older children, what occurs in educational process is automatic replacement of the first type of experience by the other two. And the representation and narrations are not acquired automatically, as they are based on conventional rules and codes: iconic, linguistic, musical and cultural. Therefore Nessia Laniado and Gianfilippo Pietra underline that in the perspective of lifelong media education the children should be taught reading virtual messages in the same way as they learn to read books. Nowadays, in the face of intense media exposure, it is needed to use media education to design psychological actions that optimize individual development. One such direction is media socialization. Its goal is to develop a stable structure of the child's personality. This future perspective of socialization through media education involves the need to combine its three classic areas of activity: teaching about media, teaching through media and teaching for media. In this way, one consistent area is created - teaching towards media, which is a foundation of self-development processes in the perspective of lifelong education.",2018,,,3005,3011

According to this paradigm, educational phenomena have been addressed in line with an extensive, equitable, and holistic logic, which includes the human being in its integral educability, that is, learning at the personal, social, and professional levels, in formal, no-formal, and informal contexts became valued (Jarvis, 2006). This new educational paradigm is also regarded as an integrating and organizing principle of education, connected to the adult's right to learn, giving it the capacity to transform the symbolic universe, values, and personal resources that can be enhanced according to the individual and collective needs (Martinez, 2002). Under this principle, adults socially excluded have the right to a quality and diversified education (Council of Europe Recommendation on Education in Prison, 2011), which must be suited to the requirements of Information Society (Castells, 2000). The European Union has developed measures that address the need to find answers to the challenges caused by the information society, in particular through the modernization of social policies. Promoting and widening the access to educational opportunities is a key element in the perspective of economical development and as a guarantee of social cohesion and ICT training plays a fundamental role in this intervention-paradigm change. In this context, E-learning has been singled out as a means to promote lifelong learning, contributing to sustainable economic growth and social cohesion. The purpose of this article is to analyse the limits and potential of e-learning as a means of lifelong learning for female prison inmates and also to present E-learning in prison project (EPRIS). This project supports ICT training initiatives associated with gender equality promotion, as a strategic instrument for a sustainable, modern and innovative social and economical development. From a methodological point of view, data was collected by document analysis and by a questionnaire submitted to the trainees. The main results show that online education may be an integration agent of individuals at risk of social and professional exclusion, and it constitutes an innovative option to training opportunities currently on offer in a correction facility context. The possibility of effective empowerment of the project beneficiaries is considerably increased since they become co-responsible for the followed pathways (starting on the problem diagnosis, solutions proposal and conception, development, training process itself, evaluation and, finally, impact assessment).",2015,,,7056,7063

Due to the permanent and accelerated changes that nowadays society crosses, the human being is also subject to the same transformative process, which determines an active and pro-active attitude at the educational level. The Lifelong learning concept is objectified in the open educational system, made of objectives, contents, forms and educational techniques that ensure the support and permanent development of the cognitive, affective and action potential of personality, of the self-education capacities and competencies, the building of independent and creative personalities. The current study aims at investigating whether and how, at the level of the teaching staff in higher education, one may continue the growing trend that Romania recorded after 1995, when an increase in the population's interest for skills upgrade courses was noticed, in view of developing and acquiring new competencies and knowledge, and of reorientation of the attitudes and behaviors from a double perspective, that of professional and social upgrade.

Even in Europe, important differences can be found among countries [2] thus, the training optometrists receive may also be disparate. To harmonize optometry education, the European Council of Optometry and Optics (ECOO) introduced the European Optometry Diploma (EDO) [3] in 2000 as a gold standard curriculum. The main aim of the project is to guide Higher Education Institutions (HEI) from India and Israel to obtain EOD accreditation. Four HEI from Europe, two from Israel and three from India received an ERASMUS+ programme grant to work on the present project. The project is divided into 5 work packages (WP): benchmarking the optometric programs (WP1), developing and piloting pedagogic resources (WP2), following a quality plan (WP3), disseminating the project outputs (WP4) and management (WP5). The kick off meeting was held in November 2016 and since then, the first steps of WP1 and WP2 and several dissemination actions have been accomplished. The first action was the gap analysis: EOD competencies that are not worked on in the curriculum. The second action was an overlapping analysis: competencies that are taught more than once throughout the curriculum. From that, a Pedagogical Transformation Plan (PTP) was written for each institution. The PTP might contain a training proposal for the faculty members of the Israel and India institutions, which consists of training sessions organized in the institutions and on-line courses. The training phase is planned to be completed during the first semester of 2018. Until now the authors conclude that: (1) The project is proceeding according to the programmed agenda, (2) the working plan is resulting in a good environment to promote teaching experience interchange among the participants and (3) faculty members mobility, as part of the training the trainers sessions, provide an excellent opportunity to visit other institutions and compare the teaching methods and strategies.",2018,,,5956,5959

Science, medicine and technology are advancing rapidly as a result of genomics, Personalized Medicine, human stem cell research (HSCR), robotics, and Big Data; healthcare workers must be prepared for a rapidly changing workplace necessitating ongoing and continual updating of information, knowledge, and praxis, as well as cognitive and manual skills. In light of the rapid expansion of knowledge of the biomedical sciences requiring continuous learning, one might logically ask the fundamental questions: Do LLL and CME represent the same conceptual domain, or do practical distinctions exist between these educational philosophies and practices? Do these distinctions impact the kinds of learning strategies for future knowledge acquisition - such as information retrieval, information literacy, evidence-based medicine, etc. - that should be integrated into medical education curricula? To answer the research questions, theoretical literature, primarily reviews and systematic reviews on CME and LLL published from 1970 - 2016, was retrieved from Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Knowledge and Google Scholar and analyzed to create an ontology for post-graduate learning philosophies and strategies in medical education and LLL. Although the concept of CME was found to possess some overlap with related educational philosophies such as 'lifelong education', 'continuing education', 'adult education', 'further education', and 'lifelong learning', CME is very strictly defined within the Anglo-American professional context of medicine as focused on improving patient care, satisfaction, and outcomes. LLL on the other hand, encompasses a much broader set of learning modalities and embraces many of the traditional liberal arts justifications for education - good citizenship, informed electorates, social harmony, inclusion, sustainability and future stewardship. CME and LLL are distinct pedagogical approaches to education, learning and knowledge, with CME more profession- and skills-based and limited to the medical domain while LLL represents a more diffuse and broad-ranging set of concepts encompassing curiosity, exploration, learning as discovery, self-development, etc.",2016,,,108,115

Ideas as education and lifelong learning society must be present in every people' mind, because a good education starts with a better perspective on parent education, on rethinking the role of adults in order to respond to the educational challenge of an ageing population in Europe. In reality, adults are not only supervisors; they are educators whose actions have many consequences for the schooling system and for the future decisions on lifelong learning activities. All these ideas are very present in European policy and EU strategic documents. A big step towards new pedagogical patterns, which involves reflecting on some educational relationships and situations, require re-thinking the role of adults, of the informal learning, and understanding that formal education must be completed by the parent's education, adapted to the global society.

However, to look beyond its apparent relationship to the knowledge economy, globalisation in education through the lens of life-long learning can shed light on other aspects crucial to the phenomenon. It is not centered on a specific method to train students for the job market. Instead, life-long learning is aimed at maximizing one's personal development that suits their individual needs. In this manner, students can complete their education with the ability to continue learning, growing, and understanding what the world has to offer. The effect of globalisation on life-long learning may not seem apparent at first, but it is shielded under schooling as the preparation for life-long learners. The school is seen as a place where students become equipped with the skills, competencies and attitudes to become part of the knowledge society. What skills should be taught to students to promote life-long learning? The response to globalisation has been transferred into education by shifting curricula to adapt to global needs. Teachers responding to this change attempt to discover different approaches to accurately represent the global world. One main aspect of globalisation is the changes in technology. Using technology in the classroom as a means to promote aspects of the changing society has become a very common trend. However, the concern is to establish a more coherent framework that encompasses the issues present in the world today and finding a way to prepare students to challenge these issues. Life-long learning represented within teaching methods is a potential means to aid students through their lives outside of the classroom.",2015,,,75,81

Mentorship has proven itself to be a superior way to learn 'on the job', as this education and training are based on problem-oriented learning relevant for the specific work setting. It has been reported that traditional educational approaches with a fixed curriculum are not efficient when it comes to meeting an organizations' needs and that it might be difficult, or even impossible, to apply what one has learned when one returns to one's workplace. Problem-oriented learning that takes place at the workplace, as an alternative to traditional courses, has many advantages; for example, such learning can be linked to everyday tasks. The digitalization of mentorship can benefit from knowledge that has been developed within traditional mentorship programs, and in particular the structure of a program. At the same time, technological development can allow for the introduction of new and innovative ways of working with lifelong learning in organizations. This paper addresses the potential benefits from e-mentorship for workplace learning. E-mentorship and mentorship systems have been studied before but not to a large extent. Based on the continuous development of digital tools and the digitalization of work practices, there is a need to understand if and when these tools can contribute to strengthening mentorship aimed at workplace learning. A model for strategic mentorship that was developed to assist mentorship in the foundry industry is presented: Strategic Mentorship for Inclusion, Learning, and Equality (SMILE). The model is discussed in relation to three advantages with e-mentorship: (i) flexibility in time and space, (ii) variety of learning formats and, (iii) access to global expertise. The general conclusion is that since the model covers several aspects of inclusion in working life, with respect to the individual's whole life-situation, e-mentorship may not be the most functional approach. Since psycho-social support is central in the model, in-person mentorship is preferred since this kind of mentorship tends to be more interactive. When it comes to online learning and e-mentorship, there are several tools that support interactivity, but they still have limitations compared to the physical meeting. The model also comprises several different areas which makes the mentorship more complex than just discussing a single task or problem. E-mentorship can however be a very good complement when there is need for flexibility in time and space, variety of learning formats and, access to global expertise. Finally, the organizational support from managers, in terms of structure and resources, determines what can be done. The provision of education to build competencies in mentorship as well as ICT skills are other aspects to include if there is a need to work strategically with mentorship and e-mentorship.",2019,,,9750,9759

On the other hand, new mechanisms of teaching-learning have appeared (Massive Open Online Courses and hybrid training) and are being established as alternatives to traditional education, driven by the development and implementation of ICTs in the educational world. In this context, lifelong learning is a clear example of this. The methods of teaching-learning, the organisation of training and also the process of attracting students to continuing education programmes have been progressively incorporating technological tools to fulfil its mission with increasing efficiency. The Lifelong Learning Centre (CFP) of the Universitat Politecnica de Valencia (UPV), aware of the need and the benefits linked to the integration of ICTs have launched several actions where technologies have paved the way to important improvements in its processes. During the 2018-19 academic courses, the CFP has attended to more than 35,000 students and carried out more than 1,500 activities of continuing education. As a result, the communication between the students and the professors and the recruitment of new students is an essential task. The marketing group of the CFP, has in its operations, integrated tools like: web analytics, social networks, and a series of disciplines encompassing digital marketing to attract students. It is worth highlighting that thanks to the web analytics tool, a vast amount of information has been gathered related to the interests of the students, which allows the CFP to improve its recruitment actions through a definition of different profiles. In addition, the new online promotion tools offer the possibility to act on a very specific public objective. Therefore, obtaining results through information associated to specific promotions help value the success of these actions. Consequently, during the last few years, the results obtained by the CFP have seen positive growth year after year, increasing the offer of training, the number of students and the income obtained. This work presents the experiences of CFP of the UPV with regards to using ICTs, its benefits, the improvement of its processes and results in attracting lifelong learning students. This has not only meant a timely incorporation of tools, but also a paradigm shift in the focus on the actors involved in continuing education.",2020,,,7892,7898

There have been many failures, and there have been some things that have gone well. Adult learning and education in some form has played a significant role in public health since, without the ongoing continuing educational interventions mainly via the mass media, the number of doctors and hospital beds would likely have been insufficient. In this paper we focus on the role of group behaviours in relation to the risk of contagion and we argue that any attempts to define a strategy to combat the pandemic must include a strong commitment to information dissemination and to the training of the populations in order to encourage behaviour change necessary to mitigate the spread of the virus. Against the backdrop of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, this article argues for commitment by governments to use adult learning and education as a tool for health prevention and health awareness and to prepare populations for whatever pandemics and national disasters that might emerge in the twenty-first century, the century of pandemics. We therefore argue that populations must have at least a basic level of literacy and numeracy as foundational skills essential for enabling citizens to receive and act on vital information during a pandemic or disaster in order to engender greater resilience(i).",2021,61,2,123,149

Next, an NPO project that offers learning activities for the poorest and lowest educated members of society in Belgium is discussed. This Fourth World NPO reaches out to persons in poverty to help them regain a place in society through building self-esteem and acquiring necessary competencies such as ICT skills by means of informal lifelong learning. The qualitative analysis of interviews with the project coordinators, volunteers and participants clarifies that low-threshold learning helps the participants to evolve from passive audience to active project volunteers and independent instructors. These moves are a first step toward social inclusion, i.e. improved self-confidence and practical skills that increase opportunities for employment.

These objectives are realised in many ways, as for example, by the people's participating in the legislation and the city's administration, by receiving a common fundamental education, including lessons of reading, writing, mathematics and astronomy; practicing sports; playing music; singing; dancing and also by taking an active role in religious festivals. The population is then divided in three groups, according to age, and they form choirs dedicated to different divinities (the children to the Muses, the young people to Apollo, the elderly to Dionysus). Thus, we may deduce that Plato was one of the ancient Greek philosophers who supported the concept of lifelong learning, expanded through various kinds of knowledge, skills and qualities.

Student-teacher interaction is at the heart of the main educational process of the university. It means that university human resources cover personal resources of all academic staff and students. Therefore, the paper discusses two subsets of human resources: the academic staff's human resources and the students' human resources. The current state of human resources is characterized by contradictions that result in problems in the successful implementation of the educational process: a) a contradiction between the need for professionals able to develop high-tech sectors of the economy and the lack of an initial level of education of the students (future specialists) that do not allow them to master an educational program with high-quality results; b) a contradiction between the development of technologies and production processes in various sectors of the economy and the lack of the university instructors' competence, that does not allow them to train master's students to a high scientific and pedagogical level. These contradictions give rise to two problems, related to the development of the human resources of the university. The first problem is how to improve the educational level of enrolled students. The second - how to train academic instructors so as to develop the required competencies. The solution of these problems is implemented according to a model that describes the work of two departments in the Lifelong Learning Institute: the Department of Academic Staff Training and the Department of Students' Competencies Development. The model includes a target unit, a content unit, and a providing unit. The composition of each unit is justified in the paper. The program was delivered in order to implement competencies development according to the model. To check whether the model was valid an experiment was carried out, based on the use of questionnaire methods and methods for the educational results' study. Competencies acquired by teachers and students as a result of the program were evaluated. Experimental data and conclusions based on their statistical treatment confirmed the hypothesis about the essential development of the competencies mastered. An increase in all studied criteria was achieved; empirical research data that characterize the state of human resources at the University before and after the experiment appear to be statistically distinguishable. The experimental work has confirmed the correctness of the theoretical assumptions concerning the model of the Lifelong Learning Institute departments' activities for university human resource development.",2017,,,2669,2673

Embedded in all of these concepts and emerging from them is the notion that access to knowledge and learning is a universal right. Infact, knowledge is increasingly regarded as the solution to individual and collective, social and economic problems. In other words, lifelong learning is an essential part in the community development process, where community members acquire their life skills, soft skills and vocational skills throughout their lifespan to take part in their social, cultural, vocational and professional life. It is indeed an intervention tool for socioeconomic empowerment in a globalizing world to stay ahead in a competitive world with knowledge superiority. In this connection, the purpose of this paper is to share the lifelong learning management experience of Covenant University in terms of its programmes, processes and strategies adopted to cope with some internal and external constraints within the context of key global trends in lifelong learning. This may be of value to lifelong learning community because Covenant University is already becoming a global brand in higher education. The idea is to provide some lessons for global lifelong learning managers as well as expose them to issues and challenges confronting lifelong learning in our own part of the globe.

Lifelong learning has become essential to all people in today's information society as a result of easy and free access to information. A basic understanding of the concept is 'learning throughout life, either continuously or periodically'. This implies that learning is not restricted to educational institutions, but can also take place in for example the public library. Public libraries thus may play an important role in supporting the learning process not the least because lifelong learning is characterised by the inclusion of informal elements of learning, flexible learning opportunities, and a shift towards self-directed learning. This self-directed learning promotes active citizenship and employability, thereby enabling people to participate in all spheres of social, political and economic life. Therefore, how do the public librarians conceive the learning responsibility and their own role in supporting lifelong learning? Furthermore, how do public librarians become better at teaching? The study reports on data from 12 interviews of purposely selected public librarians and a large-scale e-mail survey (questionnaire). The e-mail survey contained 28 questions and was sent to all staff members in public libraries in Denmark, and resulted in 986 responses. The results show that the public librarians consider the public library to be an important place for learning. The results also show how the public librarians find that they could become better at teaching and facilitating learning. This could in turn affect the sharing of knowledge and collaboration.",2014,,,26,34

However, some countries will not have sufficient knowledge-based workers to force changes in the higher education system and market-orientated Western universities will fill that gap through new means of delivery.

First, it argues that while Botswana is renowned for its economic success, it still fails to address positively such traditional challenges as poverty, unemployment and income inequality, which are increasing disproportionately, especially among the youth and non-literate adults. These structural problems can be attributable partly to the low quality of education, which does not enable learners to reduce their risks and vulnerabilities. The paper outlines the concepts of lifelong learning and sustainable development and work from there to analyse the national education policy. It is acknowledged that the state made commendable progress in delivering basic, extension and continuing education since adopting lifelong learning in 1994. However, the delivery failed to use education to transform people's lives. The education itself failed to balance quantity with quality effectively to inculcate a culture of democracy. These issues need to be critically addressed because they invariably hamper Botswana's efforts to deliver quality education and attain its vision for sustainable development. Finally, the paper suggests that the education system should incorporate lifelong learning principles, effectively involve learners in decision making and teach for empowerment.",2011,33,2,121,138

Objectives: The purpose of this Delphi study was to conceptualize lifelong learning from the perspective of nursing, and to identify characteristics and essential elements of lifelong learning. Design and Method: A Delphi Study technique in three phases was completed using an online survey tool. Data were analyzed for conceptual description, ratings of characteristics and attributes, and expert consensus in these three phases. Setting: An online survey tool was used in this study. Participants: Recognized experts in nursing education, administration and public policy participated in this study. Results: Lifelong learning in nursing is defined as a dynamic process, which encompasses both personal and professional life. This learning process is also both formal and informal. Lifelong learning involves seeking and appreciating new worlds or ideas in order to gain a new perspective as well as questioning one's environment, knowledge, skills and interactions. The most essential characteristics of a lifelong learner are reflection, questioning, enjoying learning, understanding the dynamic nature of knowledge, and engaging in learning by actively seeking learning opportunities. Keeping the mind active is essential to both lifelong learning and being able to translate knowledge into the capacity to deliver high quality nursing care. Conclusions: It is hoped that a clearer understanding of lifelong learning in nursing will foster more discussion and research about intentional, active inclusion of lifelong learning behaviors in nursing curricula.

In music, as it is in many different fields, to train highly motivated, research-oriented and updated individuals about the changes in technology is of paramount importance to promote lifelong learning. Although individualized training namely master-apprentice understanding has been favored in music education, this approach should be reconsidered to improve the participation and sustainability. In the light of all these components, music education should be done in line with the lifelong learning according to the developing and changing dynamics of the era regardless of individual's being an amateur or a professional. Most of the fields in education ongoing with traditional teaching methods gained a new perspective with the technological developments which make life and learning easier and accessible. The importance of technology, which is an indispensable part of our lives nowadays, cannot also be ignored in the progress of music within the framework of lifelong learning concept. As a result of technological developments, it is possible and easier to access not only to music, but also its meta-data, note, records, software and lots of other data quickly today, regardless of time and space while in the past it was only possible to access to music in real-time.

Known as Learning Regions Promotion of Networks, this first program transitioned into the current program, Learning on Place. A case study chosen is from the Tolzer region where a network has self-sustained from its genesis in the initial program and conducts successful Learning Festivals. The German Government funded the Learning Regions Promotion of Networks Program from 2001 to 2008, with support from the European Union (EU) Social Fund. Over 70 regions were supported with a substantial budget on a phasing-out funding basis. When this program ended in 2008, a new program titled Learning on Place began, funded by the German Government and the EU Social Fund, commencing in 2009. This program has a focus on public and private partnership in supporting good educational management in cities and rural communities. In this way, by involving private foundations as partners, a framework for civic engagement has been introduced.

These types of renewal needs require developing updated instructional practices that put a premium on adaptability to the emerging requirements of present society. However, university instruction is criticized for not coping with these new challenges while continuing to exemplify the traditional instruction. In order to overcome this critical inadequacy between current educational goals and instructional methods, the LLAF consortium is collaborating to create a curricular reform for lifelong learning (LLL) in teachers' education, health care and other applied fields. This project aims to achieve its objectives by developing, and piloting models for training students in LLL and promoting meaningful learning activities that could integrate knowledge with personal transferable skills. LLAF has created a practical guide for teachers containing updated pedagogical strategies based on the constructivist approach for learning, arranged along Delors' (1996) four theoretical 'pillars' of education: Learning to know, learning to do, learning to be, and learning to live together. This presentation will be limited to learning to do. According to this pillar, professionals must develop the ability to continue to learn in order to cope with the changing and overgrowing complexity of the context they are working within. They should become adaptive experts, which involves not simply knowing the existing best practices, but also having the skills and will to search for new practices when needed. This educational strategy will be exemplified by a case-study conducted in the pre-piloting stage of the project. The case describes a two-fold educational process implemented in a course entitled: Introduction to informal education. Step 1: Evidence-based learning - in which learning was based on reading academic articles and finding literature describing case studies and field experiences about the characteristics of informal education, its components, dimensions and its spheres of activity. Multicultural groups of students collected materials regarding the nature of informal education. The students categorized the materials found into three areas that are covered by the informal education in Israel: a. youth advancement; b. leisure time; c. social education. Then the students searched for questions that concerned them with relation to the three realms of content. The question chosen was: How to motivate youth to get involved in the community and society? Step 2: Problem-based learning - to answer the question raised, students collected materials, interviewed youth movements guides, student council members, guides in boarding schools, community center directors, instructors of youth at risk, community youth activity managers, etc. The students synthesized theory and findings from the field, followed by group and class discussions in light of the academic articles read by the group members.

In fact, this issue has always been part of the Bologna Process outline. In this line, curricula should be designed to enable students to take part in stimulating learning experiences, as well as promoting both developing and training opportunities in the course of their lives and careers. Despite the relevance given to lifelong learning in the educational system, little is known about how its dimensions are implemented and assessed in Higher Education curricula. Accordingly, this paper intends to analyze how lifelong learning skills and competences are defined in the learning outcomes proposed in the new study programs submitted to accreditation in Portugal, since 2004. Using a qualitative methodology (a lexical search), we propose a conceptual framework connecting the different terms used as lifelong learning outcomes, according to study cycles (1st, 2nd, and 3rd). In general, results reveal that Portuguese Higher Education Institutions are committed to the lifelong learning mission, particularly in the 2nd and 3rd study cycles.

Schools create lifelong learning societies and in this sense their importance is not to be underestimated. The length and the quality of the education at schools assume a critical role for the ability and motivation which are targeted at prospective learning situations. Accordingly, the strategy of lifelong learning should also include school years.

Blended and online learning provides a platform for learning that introduces technological affordance to enable learning. We seek to find an intersection between blended and online learning and lifelong learning through an instructional approach that encourages learners towards management of their own learning. This opens the door to becoming an autonomous, capable, self-directed lifelong learner. In this context, heutagogy offers an instructional approach that may connect blended and online learning settings with the development of lifelong learning competence. After conducting a systematic literature review using the terms heutagogy, blended and online learning, and lifelong learning, literature that considers how to inspire and build human agency capabilities over the lifespan was chosen for Delphi method expert review. Using this methodology, we explore the possibility that online and blended higher education will contribute, where heutagogical experiences exist, to technology-enabled lifelong learning. Results corroborate the idea that heutagogy and lifelong learning are intertwined by some common principles and that these are applicable to both blended and online learning settings and lifelong learning. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Recent, and what is often continuous, change is impacting all we do, including the design and delivery of education. This change requires new instructional models that improve immediate learning outcomes and prepares learners for learning across the lifespan. The use of instructional processes labeled heutagogy include the opportunity for, and application of, activities of learning self-direction, -determination, and -regulation, which can be helpful, even essential, for lifelong learning. What this paper adds This paper identifies an informed perspective, from data, that heutagogical design must be consciously implemented and supported for online and blended learning by instructional designers, instructors, and institutional leadership and infrastructure. It is reasonable to suggest that online and blended learning could contribute, where heutagogical learning opportunities exist, to technology-enabled lifelong learning. Instructional practices that include choice, flexible or negotiated assessment, facilitation of reflection, learner confidence development, and involvement of the learner in designing their learning can be considered heutagogical. Implications for practice and/or policy Develop policy in support of a change in instructional practice that embraces a heutagogical approach in the design of courses to foster greater self-directed and lifelong learning.

We demonstrate that social structure remains an important factor in understanding patterns of uptake and outcomes of online learning, alongside an individual's agentic behaviours. We suggest that countries such as the UK, which have become overly focused on individual interventions to increase the uptake of lifelong learning via the Internet, are going in the wrong direction.

Lifelong learning is conceived and measured as the combined knowledge gained from primary through tertiary education while the three educational indicators are: primary school enrolment; secondary school enrolment and tertiary school enrolment. Financial development dynamics are measured with financial system deposits (liquid liabilities), financial system activity (credit) and financial system efficiency (deposits/credit). Three measures of inequality are employed notably: the Gini coefficient; the Atkinson index and the Palma ratio. The estimation strategy is based on the generalised method of moments. The following findings are established. First, primary school enrolment interacts with all financial channels to exert negative effects on the Gini index. Second, lifelong learning has negative net effects on the Gini index through financial deposit and efficiency channels.

Lifelong learning, whether formal through programs and institutions or informal through self-direction, is increasingly important as a way of providing education for change, but also as a force for social justice and can be an important support for reaching these goals. The rise of the Internet and social media provides a conduit for delivery of lifelong learning that can transcend time and place, and harnessing its power can support the UN's goals for sustainable development. This paper will identify various ways that social media can support lifelong learning in relation to sustainable development. Using a four-stage model of self-directed learning, the authors will outline how social media can support each stage. In addition, the authors will provide suggestions for application of social media for lifelong learning within the social movements of environmentalism and gender equality, two aspects of sustainable development.",2018,,,143,154

Simultaneously new working procedures and strategies have developed in higher educational institutions. In 2008 European universities decided to reinforce their role in long-term learning as a means of broadening the social dimension of Higher Education and of responding to the demands of a changing society. Particularly, with regard to Lifelong Learning, the university has become a committed protagonist in order to confront demographic change in European society, specifically in relation to the growth of the older population who wish to complete their higher education studies, the increase of immigrant integration and the need to respond to the educational requirements of people affected by the economic cycle. Within this context, diversified educational activities have been introduced, from specific learning needs to cultural learning opportunities for older generations. In order to answer these demands, universities can act alone or in collaboration with other institutions, employment agencies and workers' organisations. Lifelong learning requires that universities find new ways to meet the needs of current students with different motivations and interests. This generally implies a different approach to university learning, that is not limited to a specific period in life, but that also helps former students to return with focused programmes with the aim of improving, updating and extending their learning process. On these lines, the main aim of this paper is to present the renovation of the University of Valencia (UVEG) Programme for Mature Students (La Nau Gran), by offering a comparative study of the initial developments and current situation of these programmes in Spain. In order to observe the different adaptations that they will have to consider, the methodology of the study is based on the visits to, and proposals by, each university centre, on the evaluations carried out over recent years on the various academic itineraries and the participating lecturers, and on interviews with lecturers and students. The present research will expound the two major guidelines that University Programmes for Mature Students should follow in forthcoming years, taking into consideration the legislation currently proposed by Government and the demands of ESHE.",2011,,,1112,1124

Social education and lifelong learning (shougai gakushuu) are terms used to refer to adult education and related activities in Japan. Adult education originated immediately after Second World War with the enactment of the Fundamental Law of Education (1947; revised in the 1980s). Since the mid-1980s lifelong learning has been the more commonly used term. Lifelong learning involves not only going to school to learn how to read and write, it can also involve the learning that takes place outside the classroom-through volunteering, outdoor activities, sporting events, and so on. A literature review was conducted as the means to pursue the aim of introducing ecotourism into adult education. Education for Sustainable Development was examined to see how its contexts can be applied to Japan's adult education. This paper is aimed specifically at how the host community can learn, from adult education centers in their communities, to practice a sustainable ecotourism. Although there have been researchers and communities who are against ecotourism practices, this paper maintains that, with proper education in night schools and adult and community centers, of the benefits of ecotourism these communities will accept and welcome ecotourism.

Most of these efforts have focused on establishing how coaches learn; yet the actual impact of specific coach education and development interventions has received considerably less attention. Moreover, the role of coach developers in facilitating this impact remains largely unknown. To address this knowledge gap, this study used a realist evaluation approach to engage in a detailed exploration of a large-scale, multi-annual coach education and development intervention with high school coaches in the Philippines. Using interviews and focus groups at two different time points with multiple stakeholders, this study established a series of context, mechanism and outcome configurations that provide a nuanced perspective on how coach education and development works. More specifically, this paper offers a novel interpretation of the role of coach developers as 'motivators for lifelong learning' established through three key mechanisms: 1) being available, approachable, and supportive; 2) creating a sense of belonging; and 3) raising coaches' aspirations by increasing their sense of purpose and duty.

The interim results of a large-scale study of patterns of participation in post-compulsory education and training are used to suggest that progress towards such a society is uneven and far from certain. Increasing full-time continuous participation by itself does not lead to patterns of lifelong learning, nor does simply increasing the number of existing opportunities or reducing the impact of barriers to participation (however laudable these objectives may be). More research is needed to uncover the specific determinants of participation in various types of formal learning as they are identified here, but it is already clear that while some forms of participation are susceptible to policies of widening access, others are less so. The latter may only be significantly altered by adjustments to the inequalities in society, but unless we are clear which is which this new round of policies on lifelong learning may be directed at the wrong target.",1998,35,4,275,281

Mover-stayer status is not observed, and we therefore model wages using an endogenous switching regression, estimated by maximum likelihood. Methodologically, the results support the mover-stayer characterisation since the restrictions required for the simpler specifications popular in the literature are rejected.

This study compared self-reported measures of demographics, life satisfaction, cognitive status, and mood states in adult populations (over 50 years old). These older adults were attending noncredit courses in two different adult education programs: an adult education center and a university setting. Students in the two programs differed in several demographic features (age, years of formal education, socioeconomic status, and satisfaction with life). While both groups reported the same level of cognitive functioning, adult education students found the classes more familiar yet more challenging. Students in both programs reported an improvement in mood at the end of the class compared to the beginning. This study suggests that demographic variables, such as years of formal education, socioeconomic status, and life satisfaction, may determine which lifelong learning program adults choose. Regardless of program choice, participation in noncredit lifelong learning programs improves the mood of adults and may provide longer term benefits to their overall health and well-being. Further research is needed to determine whether the degree of challenge (Salthouse, Merish, & Miles, 2002) or lack of familiarity (Park, Gutchess, Meade, & Stine-Morrow, 2007) with the material will influence whether participation in lifelong learning programs has a lasting impact on cognitive health.",2010,36,5,425,434

Commissioned programs, on the other hand, typically require a high level of commitment, such as constant engagement in learning and rigorous assessment of knowledge. However, comparatively less light is shed on the designs and impacts of commissioned education than the other lifelong learning and professional development methods. This paper, therefore, presents a systematic empirical study on design, execution and evaluation of commissioned education based on a program at masters' level for middle and senior project managers offered for seven years at the Department of Computer and Systems Sciences, Stockholm University. The program is evaluated at the end of every academic year, and the reforms are duly implemented. Impact of these reforms is systematically evaluated based on perceptions of the teachers and students of the program. Blended form of courses offering was voted best in contrast of complete online and face-to-face forms, with a structure of classroom meetings in the beginning and the end of a course, and synchronised online meetings for formative assessments. Didactical indicators included problem-based learning approaches that tights the workplace problems into course assignments and formative discussions. Need for pre-planning with adequate information about the course workload and deadlines, increased communication between stakeholders, flexibility and efficiency in the course offers are identified as essential success factors. Emotional support from the family is also recognized as an equally important factor in adult learning. A formal education qualification such as a master's degree is a difficult goal to achieve in one step, and should ideally be achieved by aggregating short term goals such as certifications of shorter durations, according to the outcome of the study.",2019,,,276,283

These changes, in combination with increased focus on patient safety and physician competence, place even greater demands on practicing in the surgical subspecialties. In this environment, finding time to improve skills and gain competence in new procedures is a daunting task. This article addresses the topic of surgical competence, provides insight into how to learn to do and prove competence to perform new surgical procedures, as well as reviews the opportunities available for self-evaluation currently available for the practicing surgeon.",2007,18,2,129,131

Global economics and societies, involved in faster and faster changes, require higher and higher competencies, skills and knowledge. The ability to produce and use knowledge has become a major factor in development (World Bank, 2009). Improved people will be able to compete in global markets but they will be able to cooperate actively as memberships of societies and/or communities. So, lifelong learning, training and education will be key to contribute to increase social cohesion, reduce crime, and improve income distribution and to contribute to the growth of economic, scientific and cultural knowledge too. So, there's a growing need to lifelong and lifewide widespreadly update people's knowledge, competences and skills. The aim of this paper is to analyze the context of nowadays globalized economies and societies, to pick out data, issues and needs, to draw attention on all those aspects for stressing pedagogical and political debate. Analyses are deepened with a systemic-relational approach and hermeneutic, heuristic and critical method. International indicators, such as by OECD or EU data, may offer a comparative framework for analysis, useful for education policies, pedagogists and educational researchers to improve extent and quality in the educational offer and to contribute to increase development and well-being of people.

What has Singapore done to develop an education system that facilitates its young to learn in such an era? Firstly, Singapore enhances the adaptive capacity of its education system by increasing its diversity. In particular, it is developing more educational pathways, areas of learning and types of schools. Secondly, Singapore emphasizes lifelong learning. In particular, Singapore will be focusing on providing more learning opportunities for working adults and enhancing support for mid-career reskilling. In these educational changes, Singapore has been addressing both hardware (changing policies) and software (addressing culture), in order to develop an education system that can facilitate learners to learn in an era of uncertainty. What will help Singapore in further developing such a system? This paper suggests two software upgrades, namely inspiration by design and readiness for paradigm shift. Firstly, instead of a paradigm of competence, Singapore adopts a paradigm of inspiration. In this paradigm, the aim is for students to find their inspiration to learn, and such inspiration is provided through a systemic approach. This is inspiration by design. Secondly, Singapore nurtures the spirit of readiness for paradigm shifts in education. An example of a paradigm shift is to be ready for the advent of artificial intelligence in education. Such readiness is about reflecting on fundamentals so that the use of artificial intelligence enhances the development of real human intelligence.",2023,,,,

Since the late twentieth century, LLL has primarily been seen through a Eurocentric lens, with a strong focus on the development of skills for knowledge-based economies and societies. As this discourse has been promoted and adopted by so-called developing countries, the focus has shifted from an identified need for continuous learning in a global society to mainly targeting the promotion of basic education, as is evidenced by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In this context, we have identified a need for further discussion and research on intercultural universities, many of which are becoming increasingly vulnerable in current neoliberal times. This article looks at two intercultural universities in Mexico and Ecuador and suggests that a more indigenized approach to LLL could provide a stronger sense of ownership and participation in decision-making. Thus, LLL can be an ally for a new and decolonized conceptual framework that further legitimizes intercultural universities and provides a long-term strategy for the future.",2019,17,3,347,361

Methods: We analyzed 48 medical oaths written from the first century CE through the present day, searching for a commitment to lifelong learning and for specification of a relationship to the principle of beneficence. Thirteen ancient and medieval and 35 modem and contemporary oaths were inventoried for source, such as corresponding to a medical school. They were sorted by those that mention the commitment toward lifelong learning and to determine their relationship with the principle of beneficence. Results: Of the 48 medical oaths analyzed, only 20 manifest the commitment to lifelong learning. However, most of the oaths that contain this commitment do not pertain to medical schools, with the exception of the Declaration of Geneva. Of this group, 16 also indicate the principle of beneficence. Of these 16, only 3 establish a link between both. One medical oath indicated this commitment, and none of them analyzed the relation with the principle of beneficence.

This is achieved by maintaining digital hashes of learning activities and managing access rights through the use of smart contracts on the blockchain. The blockchain of learning logs (BOLL) is a platform that enable learners to move their learning records from one institution to another in a secure and verifiable format. This primarily solves the cold-start problem faced by learning data analytic platforms when trying to offer personalized experience to new learners. BOLL enables existing learning data analytic platforms to access the learning logs from other institutions with the permission of the learners and/or institution who originally have ownership of the logs.

Lifelong learning concept offers the prospect of a radical new approach especially for the higher educational process focused on the opening up traditional universities for those who want to learn lifelong. In the same time, educational institutions, universities most of all, are facing a number of challenges: globalization, aging society; growing competition between higher educational institutions both national and international, and rapid technological development. To answer successfully to all these challenges, in the opinion of most of the specialists, traditional universities must transform themselves by adopting a lifelong learning system. This system will transform how universities currently teach. To achieve this transformation, universities will have to introduce strategies and policies which implement flexible academic frameworks, innovative pedagogical approaches, new forms of assessments and institutional collaboration.

The authors maintain that if these activities are properly structured within practice organizations, they can become powerful engines of socialization to enhance physicians' lifelong learning and commitment to medical professionalism. They propose that this prom ise can be realized if new or reformed practice organizations combine education and service delivery and institutionalize processes of individual and collective reflection. The resulting institutions of reflective practice would be ones of collegial, experiential, reflective lifelong learning concerning the technical and normative aspects of medical work. They would extend recent methods of medical education such as problem-based learning into the practice setting and draw on extant methods used in complex organizations to maximize the advantages and minimize the disadvantages that practice organizations typically present for adult learning. As such, these institutions would balance the potentially conflicting organizational needs for, on the one hand, (1) self-direction risk taking, and creativity; (2) specialization; and (3) collegiality; and, on the other hand, (4) organizational structure, (5) coordination of division of labor, and (6) hierarchy. Overall, this institutionalization of reflective practice would enrich practice with education and education with practice, and accomplish the ideals of what the authors call responsive medical professionalism.

Challenges facing lifelong learning in Japan do not simply mean the acquisition of competency as often discussed in Western countries.

Moreover, the dynamic economic, political and social changes that innovations have brought about have made lifelong learning a paramount issue. While in the 1990s the learning focus was on vocational skills, in the twenty-first century lifelong learning has become a much more holistic experience. Learning competencies no longer refer to just occupational skills but also include personal growth, social and team interactions, management training as well as individual autonomy. While ICT is still an important component, the context is now much broader and includes socio-political, psychological and educational dimensions that recognize that individuals are not solitary beings but interact with society and organizations. This paper looks at some EU initiatives, especially the EQF and the LQF, the Latvian Qualifications Framework that is derived from the EQF. It also looks at some American initiatives where direct competencies assessment is currently in operation at about 5% of the higher education institutions. The author concludes that while important steps have been taken to create universally recognized education assessment criteria for lifelong learning, these criteria at present do not have universal validity. Moreover, they are still too vocationally and business orientated. More needs to be done to develop cognitive learning abilities to build relevant interactions between theory and practice.

Wider access to learning activities of adults is understood as an important feature of a learning society. Libraries belong to those culture institutions, which can provide non-formal education and informal learning. It is important for supporting the participation of adults in further learning, because in many cases adults do not plan to enter formal education programs. The aim of this paper is to present how the potential of libraries for opening access to lifelong learning opportunities is evaluated by adult people in present time in the Czech Republic. A particular survey of attitudes of adult people was carried out in March 2017 in the region of Hradec Kralove. The goal of the survey was to find out, if the role of libraries in lifelong learning is understood and used by adults as the target group of librarian activities. A quantitative research strategy was chosen - the questionnaire was distributed among adults with an experience with learning activities in the adult age and expected positive attitude towards learning. At first the opportunity of respondents to use regularly a library and librarian services was investigated, followed by the habits of respondents to use these services and their participation in educational programs of libraries - lectures, lecture cycles, workshops etc. The data were analyzed and interpreted in connection with the gender and age characteristics and the social status. According to the survey results, the access to libraries and using the librarian services are very high and reach more than 90 %, but the participation in educational programs organized by libraries is substantially lower and does not reach 50 %.

It sought to gather insights into young children's perceptions of environmental sustainability and the influences that shaped these perceptions, particularly in the context of the family and the school. This qualitative multiple case study comprised 12 children (aged between three and seven years), 10 parents, five teachers and a head teacher. Data were generated through observations in two State primary schools and one household; conversational interviews with children; children's interpretations of photographs; children's drawings and interpretation of them; interviews with parents, teachers and head teacher; a researcher's journal and document analysis. The findings are meaningful for lifelong learning for sustainability in that they show that children's perceptions of the environment and environmental sustainability started at an early age; were influenced by context; and were socially and culturally constructed. Children were able to discuss issues related to environmental sustainability at a basic level by drawing on personal experience.

Across the Metis homeland, political leaders, activists, educators, and community members have collectively worked to respond to educational needs through a variety of initiatives with the restoration of cultural knowledge and pride as a primary undertaking. Reflecting social literacy aims, the Metis are sustaining a tradition of lifelong learning activities that seek decolonising and self-determining goals that help make sense of their lived experiences through a collective approach.

In this moment the platform is in a phase of complete redevelopment and the final objective will be the adaption of the typical approaches of the web 2.0 and social networks into an e-learning formal platform. In particular one of the objectives will be to integrate an informal learning metaphor into a classic formal one. The term informal learning has been used in education field, in particular in the adult education, for several reasons; one of them is providing to the learners a greater flexibility in the learning process. This approach highlights that the lessons from the others could have a great social significance, but implies that the education agencies (e.g. the universities or the training institutions) have the capability to increase the socialisation level into the learning environment. Following the informal learning approach is necessary to focus the attention to the learning that takes place in the spaces surrounding the activities that take place in a much wider variety of settings than the formal education and training. This approach is not a substitute of the formal learning but could be complementary, integrating the personal experiences and the learning exchanges with the other participants. We will introduce the problems related to the integration of these two different logics into a single e-learning platform (learning spaces and social networks), and how to connect these two worlds into one single architecture.

This detachment from nature results in a lowering in the sense of ownership of the land and its resources and subsequently results in less motivation to conserve it. In order to reverse such behaviours and attitudes, a new programme termed 'Lifelong Learning through Nature' (LLN) was devised. This study is an analysis of the LLN programme and its potential for making links between outdoor learning, fieldwork and education for sustainable development. These results shed light on the effectiveness of the programme in influencing knowledge and attitudes and, in turn, lead to formulate a way forward in the programme's evolution. Outdoor education is an essential element of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) which is key to address the current situation for a sustainable future. The data was collected through a number of focus groups with students from a number of different schools from the Maltese islands. Each group of students was researched through a pre-activity focus group and a post-activity focus group. The data was then transcribed and translated and subsequently analysed through a structured thematic analysis. The results revealed a great sense of detachment in the young students and eventually a greater sense of pointlessness in the older students. The post-focus groups indicated excellent improvement in knowledge and a perceptible change towards a more positive attitude across the ages. This study reveals that the LLN programme does have an influential role in the knowledge and attitudes of school children towards nature. This study continues to uphold the vision that outdoor education should be considered as a main activity which involves and results in ESD. In response to these findings, a model illustrating the emerging links between the LLN programme and various factors is presented. This paper directly illustrates how university research in teamwork with non-governmental organisations can impact the local community and the study will be useful to anyone interested in carrying out effective programmes and research into the links between ESD and outdoor education.",2018,,,165,182

Several assessment tools embedded in a selected set of engineering courses along with their assessment methodologies, data analysis and conclusions are presented in this manuscript. The selected courses are spread over at the sophomore, junior, and senior levels. The courses include Engineering Dynamics, Fluid Mechanics, Propulsion Systems, and the Senior Design Capstone project. With the exception of the last course, students were assigned a set of open-ended problems that involved a wide range of engineering and real-world applications that students might encounter as practicing engineers or as graduate students. Information sources were restricted to peer-reviewed published work such as journal articles, conference proceedings, and books. Students were directed to use the main engineering digital databases Engineering Village or Compendex, which provide comprehensive coverage of literature in all engineering fields. Unsupported assertions or claims were a basis of rejection or grade reduction of the project grade. The attainment level of the lifelong learning competency was assessed using two performance indicators. The first performance indicator comprised of measures of students' ability to recognize the attributes of a lifelong learner, the significance of lifelong learning, and identification of sources for continuing education. This performance indicator was assessed using a comprehensive online survey that students filled out upon completion of the research project. The second indicator focused on students' ability to independently perform an in-depth analysis, produce quality work, and use various resources to learn new material not taught in class. This performance indicator was assessed using technical report grading rubrics. Students' feedback, survey, and reports analysis, all indicated that the methodology has been successfully implemented.

B4E stores not only certificates but also learners' training data such as transcripts and educational programs in order to create a complete record of the lifelong education of each user and verify certificates that they have obtained. As a result, B4E can address two types of fake certificates, i.e., certificates printed by unlawful organizations and certificates issued by educational institutions for learners who have not met the training requirements. In addition, B4E is designed to allow all participants to easily deploy software packages to manage, share, and check stored information without depending on a single point of access. As such, the system enhances the transparency and reliability of the stored data. Our experiments show that B4E meets expectations for deployment in reality.",2022,43,2,591,604

Roma are here described as a 'hidden minority' (see the country study about Italy from Valeria Cavioni in the book Lifelong Learning and the Roma Minority in Western and Southern Europe (2019)), because - although they are the largest minority group living in Europe for more than a hundred years - we still know very little about them. Although most of the Roma people have been living for centuries in European countries, their situation is still different from the non-Roma population; they often suffered from poverty and exclusion. There is a host of Roma, especially in Southern and in Eastern Europe, who is considered to be the most disadvantaged group in European societies; that is, regarding their (1) health situation, (2) on the labour, (3) on the housing market and (4) also in education. Questions of education are the central elements of politics making the situation of Roma better. To fulfil these requirements, some European countries have taken determined steps. As Natascha Hofmann in the country study about Germany wrote in the book Lifelong Learning and the Roma Minority in Western and Southern Europe (2019), we are in the phase of the 'dawn of learning' because there are more and more policies and programmes to develop attainment and success of Roma in European education and lifelong learning. This book wants to change this and gives an overview about retrospective and prospective tendencies in the situation of European Roma in education and lifelong learning.",2019,,,1,13

There is an answer. Quite simply, these efforts have been directed at solving the wrong problems. At the root of educational failures lies a fundamental problem that has been almost universally overlooked: Students have never been taught how to learn. Students are thrown into their school years and basic subjects without ever first being taught how to go about learning those subjects. As they grow older they are confronted by more and more complex areas of study, still without ever having acquired the skills with which to assimilate information, evaluate its relative importance and put it to use. This has been the vital missing ingredient that has hampered all fields of study. It handicaps both student in school and adults in life. Thus, many students find education a trying and difficult process. They never master the ability to rapidly learn something with certainty and ease. Others, even though they apparently have less difficulty studying, find they are unable to apply what they have read. It is a reality of the modern world that anyone in the work force, whether on the factory floor or in the executive suite, must have an ability to assimilate important information, retain it and then be able to apply it. This process, whether formal or informal, is what is meant by study. This study focused on three objectives: Improving the quality of education and training systems, making access to learning easier, opening education and training to the world. The aim of this study is to given methods to improve the quality of education and which standards are determined the quality and for supporting this idea; Turkey's education system example will be examined with right and wrong sides.",2010,,,1426,1436

In a heutagogical approach to teaching and learning, learners are highly autonomous and self-determined and emphasis is placed on development of learner capacity and capability with the goal of producing learners who are well-prepared for the complexities of today's workplace. The approach has been proposed as a theory for applying to emerging technologies in distance education and for guiding distance education practice and the ways in which distance educators develop and deliver instruction using newer technologies such as social media. The renewed interest in heutagogy is partially due to the ubiquitousness of Web 2.0, and the affordances provided by the technology. With its learner-centered design, Web 2.0 offers an environment that supports a heutagogical approach, most importantly by supporting development of learner-generated content and learner self-directedness in information discovery and in defining the learning path. Based on an extensive review of the current literature and research, this article defines and discusses the concepts of andragogy and heutagogy and describes the role of Web 2.0 in supporting a heutagogical learning approach. Examples of institutional programs that have incorporated heutagogical approaches are also presented; based on these examples and research results, course design elements that are characteristic of heutagogy are identified. The article provides a basis for discussion and research into heutagogy as a theory for guiding the use of new technologies in distance education.",2012,13,1,56,71

Qualitative and quantitative study pattern was used. The cosmos of the research was constituted by all the nurses (N: 325) who worked in an official inpatient care institution affiliated to T.C Ministry of Health in Istanbul. Research was realized with 269 volunteer nurses without any pick of sample.

Each nurse was asked to complete the blanks in the sentence, 'Lifelong learning is like a/an.....................because..................'to reveal the perceptions of the nurses about the lifelong learning. The metaphors were gathered under 5 conceptual categories in terms of purposes-important-benefit of life long learning on the basis of metaphoric expressions. Nurses produced 139 metaphors for life long learning. More than half of the metaphors (95) were represented by a nurse. The remaining 46 metaphors were expressed by 2-20 nurses. The top four metaphors were baby, water, tree, and children, respectively. Most of the nurses regard lifelong learning as a necessity of constant change and development while thinking that learning realizes at every age and every place either consciously or unconsciously and lastly, they render lifelong learning possible, only by learning to learn. According to these conclusions, metaphors may be utilized as a strong research mean in order to reveal, understand and explain individual perceptions and mental images. There is a need for a wide range of qualitative researches analyzing nurses perceptions of lifelong learning and metaphorical analysis of their thoughts concerning lifelong learning. Examination of these researches' results in education programs would provide a big profit in determining nurses points of view towards lifelong learning. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Evidence has seen a shift from an individualistic to a more collective approach to reflection, in an attempt to move away from viewing learning as an individual action. Simultaneously attention has been given to socio-cultural theories which view learning as social practice inherent in our everyday lives, including work. This paper aims to engage in the current debate regarding the polarised conceptualisations of reflective practice within the context of professional learning. Drawing on this debate, as well as on learning metaphors, this paper proposes that professionals should engage in collective reflective practice for both individual and organisational development within workplaces; locations which could be seen as increasingly ambiguous and unpredictable throughout individuals' working lives. Hence, we need to rehabilitate and extend some of the key aspects of the traditional concept of reflective practice to accommodate the changing terrain of professional practice within an individual professional's lifelong learning.",2019,41,1,1,16

However, different authors remain divided on the question of what constitutes 'lifelong learning ability'. This article proposes the hypothesis that the cultivation of lifelong learning abilities in higher education needs to be conceptualised and sustained through a focus on the constitution and operation of agency. The cultivation of lifelong learning as a set of agent abilities needs to be grounded within the mode of being, a concept inspired by Heidegger, rather than within having or doing. While the importance of developing epistemology by focusing on learning as delivery (having) and interacting (doing) is not denied, this article suggests that higher education also concerns ontological learning. The Heideggerian perspective on being provides a more person-focused approach that is useful for providing balance and congruence between feeling and thought and between mind and body, supplementing the having and doing approaches by inviting students to reflect on their own growth and leading not only to knowledge construction for problem-solving but also to the construction of subjectivity as a means of finding meaning in the learner's existence in times of uncertainty.",2011,62,4,399,412

This is an empirical study with a qualitative approach. We interviewed teachers and students about their perceptions of e-learning. The interviews were semi-structured and allowed for reflections. All students interviewed were currently employed in industry and active e-learners. A web-based horizon scanning was made to identify trends in order to understand future context. The study is part of an academic development project with the intention of strengthening academic capacity and company knowledge to stay competitive in an international setting. In this paper, we present several cornerstones for creating courses that are suitable for professionals. Administrative routines and procedures need to be adjusted in order to meet challenges from other actors and the needs of stakeholders. A seamless experience would be preferred from a consumer-oriented perspective, where flexibility is a key factor. This flexibility is manifested by the need to control their own workload to adjust the work-education balance. Locus of learning needs to be problematized.

Therefore professional engineers who are committed to LLL will be in greater demand. Qualified engineers who are less skilled or have no capacity to upgrade their skills or adapt to rapid changes will less likely find attractive employment. The role of instructors in understanding and applying LLL competency cannot be overemphasised.

However, there has been limited research into the opportunities for lifelong learning within the context of volunteering and this is a largely unexplored area within educational research. This paper presents my ongoing PhD research, which explores the learning experiences of volunteers within three UK based health and social charities. In particular, the research focuses on how these volunteers are being trained to perform service-providing roles. Such roles, which directly support users of the charity's services, can be challenging and often address complex issues. Therefore initial and ongoing training is a vital part of the volunteer process. This study has taken a multiple case study approach using multiple qualitative methods. Research findings so far suggest that training in this context does not simply just provide necessary information to volunteers but offers a powerful space for continuous learning. An important learning resource within training across all cases is the multiple perspectives and histories of participating volunteers and staff, and volunteers benefited from having the space to share these experiences and expertise. Through training volunteers gained the confidence needed to perform their role, but they also gained a deeper understanding of and increased confidence for talking about the issue of the charity. Whilst in some cases this personal learning led to career changes or further study in formal education, most prominently it enabled collective transformation as volunteers contributed to wider awareness raising, both within and outside of their volunteer role. In this paper, I draw upon social theories of learning and in particular Activity Theory, to theorise learning in the volunteer context as a continuous, ongoing process with the potential for transformation for volunteers, the organisations they are volunteering within and their wider communities. By studying this relatively unexplored environment of non-formal learning I hope that the findings will be useful in increasing understanding of the different areas in which lifelong learning can be supported.",2015,,,3508,3515

This learning environment pursues three main goals: acquiring declarative and conditional knowledge about learning strategies, consolidating that knowledge, and applying these learning strategies in practice. In this report, we describe four experimental studies conducted to optimize this learning environment (n = 336). With those studies, we improved the learning environment with respect to how motivating it is, investigated an efficient way to consolidate knowledge, and explored how to facilitate the formation of effective implementation intentions for applying learning strategies and changing learning habits.

Nurses' orientation toward lifelong learning has not been explored, despite its potential effect on the success of such programs. Methods: The Jefferson Scale of Physician Lifelong Learning (JSPLL) was used to measure orientation toward lifelong learning among 200 nurses at Uganda's national hospital. Results: Most participants had fair orientation (52%) toward lifelong learning (JSPLL mean score = 36.8 [SD = 7.2]) and rated their skills in self-directed learning as good or excellent (44%). Reported barriers to lifelong learning included patient workload, lack of mentors, lack of library resources, and lack of computer skills. Nurses' orientation toward lifelong learning was significantly associated with professional experience (p <= .05), age (p <= .05), and education level (p <= .01). Conclusion: In Uganda, nurses' orientation toward lifelong learning remains low, and this has implications for successful implementation of continuing education programs for nurses.

This paper is a reflection on the mid-term results of the project, which has been running for 2 years since 2011. It is funded by the EU Programme ALFA III2 that aims at promoting higher education in Latin America (LA) as a means to contribute to the economic and social development of the region. The project addresses the program-priorities on strengthening social cohesion between Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and society through reinforcing the linkages between universities and their stakeholders (business, authorities, civil society, etc), and by developing measures at regional level to promote equitable access to HEIs. Planned activities in the project already realized, refer to the implementation of prototype models for lifelong learning curricula, raising awareness of LLL-perspectives through consultation of relevant stakeholders (social partners, enterprises, 3rd sector, etc.), competence-based curricula-design including a system of credit recognition, assessment and accreditation. Other important activities realized, concern the definition of an e-learning strategy and the elaboration of a system of procedures and tools safe-guarding quality assurance and peer-assessment of the learning processes. Reflecting on the results of the project so far brings up the following observations: The meaning of LLL in EU and LA, especially in its function of supporting social and economic progress needs to be based on a thorough benchmark and analysis of existing learning cultures in both continents. Lessons learned about the lack of a systematic use of the notion of competences, mark important learning experiences. Methods for the recognition of prior learning outcomes and credits as transferable units are important innovative aspects in the framework of the project. These lessons also stress the relevance of engaging in pilots for developing and testing a model for the recognition of learning outcomes (prior: formal, informal and non-formal) that focuses more on learner's needs and local contexts than on the content of courses and training pathways. The merits have been proven of the elaboration of an effective methodology for cooperation between EU and LA for supporting initiatives as ALCUE3 (Common Area of Higher Education between EU, LA and the Caribbean for the creation of an environment for bilateral and multilateral cooperation in higher education systems) and the EU-LA and Caribbean Summit(4) (Madrid, May 18th 2010). It is vital to design a project management infrastructure that is capable of coordinating the high level of complexity when building up transatlantic cooperation and knowledge exchange between heterogeneous partners in a diversity of learning cultures. From this arises the awareness that the multi-dimensional features of language, methodology & didactics, laws, educational systems, socio-cultural paradigms have great impact on the diversity of LLL-strategies in both continents. This awareness led to adopting a bottom-up approach in addressing the challenges met in rebalancing Transatlantic relations between EU and LA in higher education.",2013,,,5997,6007

Using data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) for the period 1991-2006, our approach and findings represent an important addition to the existing evidence base. By using annual data, we are able to employ the fixed effects estimator, which eliminates the problem of time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity. Our dynamic specification uses a lag structure to consider how earnings returns evolve in the medium and longer run, whilst also controlling for wage trends which were evident prior to qualification attainment. Our results show a medium-run return for women of 10% on hourly wages. For men, initial suggestions of a similar positive return are eliminated once pre-qualification trends are taken into account. This suggests that adult learning has a causal effect on women's subsequent earnings but, for men, any apparent gain is due to selection. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Setting: Socioeconomic disparities in health are a major public health concern in economically developed nations where improving socioeconomic status (e.g. formal educational attainment) at the population level is challenging. In the light of population ageing, alternative approaches to improve health through malleable factors are urgently needed. Recent research suggests that participation in organised learning activities - lifelong learning - could attenuate the lack of formal educational attainment on health. Methods: Data come from the 2012 wave of the US Health and Retirement Study. Structural equation models with bootstrapping were used to estimate the mediation effect of lifelong learning activity in the relationship between self-rated health and formal educational attainment. Results: Approximately 3%-5% of the effect of formal education on self-rated health was mediated by lifelong learning activity. Findings from this study support the notion that ongoing participation in organised learning activities is beneficial for health in later life.

Education is presumed to be a social system, or 'autopoiesis' that functionally differentiates and expands itself by self-referential reproduction. In this context, lifelong learning is a relative newcomer with new frameworks and ideas, which sometimes conflict with traditional education, and institutionalizes itself by competing the contested terrains of the system, most of which are preoccupied by early sectors of education. In this paper, I focus on how the 'idea' of lifelong learning embodies into the system, secures its own education spaces, and keeps expansive reproductions as a part of the education system in general.",2017,18,2,281,294

The case study described, conducted in North Cyprus in 2015 followed a qualitative research methodology: semi-structured interviews and document analysis were used for data collection. The study sample of 20 orthopedically impaired participants was selected from among members of the Cyprus Turkish Association for the Orthopedically Disabled which asked for volunteers. The study concluded that impaired learners typically satisfy their social and learning needs, or their need for excitement and relaxation, through social media. It is clear that the use of social networking only satisfies individual needs and does not contribute to group interdependence: if orthopedically impaired learners actively directed themselves to communicating more effectively among themselves and creating groups, they could solve personal problems through group solidarity. Social networks contribute to orthopedically impaired learners' lifelong education process: in addition to providing them with positive gratification, they also informally contribute to their personal education. Although the individuals who participated in this study do use social networks, more effort needs to be made within the context of North Cyprus to make use of social networks for formal education purposes.",2016,19,1,41,52

The increasing complexity of the world requires companies and society to anticipate future needs, and to that end, they need a strong commitment to promoting talent, lifelong learning and innovation. Moreover, the speed of this change is increasing exponentially with respect to previous revolutions. In this context, educational systems must adapt to be proactive in facing future challenges while still solving those of the present. Among the consequences of current technological maturity, we find that the wage gap is decreasing; and that economic and organizational competitiveness is now based on superior technology and human talent. Consequently, this fast pace of technological change requires a concomitant increase in the ability to acquire new competencies. As a result, innovative training approaches are emerging in order to overcome the slow pace and many obstacles placed by existing practices in Europe, which remain traditional and formal. In this article, today's most innovative and better-performing training approaches are discussed, and their common features described.",2019,,,3289,3293

A further reason is that the Public Choice account of government failure treats the identification of shortcomings in state policy as an argument in favour of increasing market forces. The potential role of professional and other communities is ignored. We present a new framework for understanding government failure which we term 'policy fracture' and use this framework to analyse lifelong learning policy in relation to older learners.

Much of the lifelong learning policy experience has been either ineffective or drifting in and out of policy discussions unnoticed. Yet, in 2015, Singapore launched a new policy initiative known as SkillsFuture, which brought lifelong learning back into mainstream policy. In this paper, we re-examine the origins of lifelong learning as a concept with a view of providing useful points of reference for policy discussion in Singapore. We employ the Delors Four Pillars of lifelong learning and data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) to make a comparison between Singapore and its international peers. We use this comparison to identify potential policy challenges that lie ahead for Singapore. We argue that the historical focus in Singapore on formal education, both pre-employment and continuing, provides a solid foundation for lifelong learning. Nevertheless, recent policy shifts have begun to bring the humanistic elements of learning - for example, living together and self-actualization - back to the front stage of policy for learning. This is where potential policy gaps may exist in Singapore, as the utilitarian emphasis has dominated for a long time. An understanding of these different elements of lifelong learning and how they are linked in Singapore's context will be valuable for policymakers and practitioners to prepare for the challenges ahead.",2017,37,4,615,628

The Don State Technical University, Russia, has a unique experience of lifelong learning as it provides education to the students of all ages. The university has developed a wide range of educational programs for secondary schooling, higher education and post graduate programs, educational programs for elderly people and many others. Lifelong learning comprises both studying at the educational institutions of different levels and self-learning. The success of this process is impossible without some personal qualities such as self-control, responsibility, autonomy. The authors consider fostering these qualities to be an important task of education at different levels among the students of different ages. The objective of the paper is to present the techniques and methods of self-control formation among students which were developed and successfully applied at the Don State Technical University. The theoretical basis of our research is a psychological theory of personality. The technique of self-control formation is based on step by step replacement of teachers' control over the learners' progress by mutual learners' - teachers' control and later by learners' self-control over the progress in the learning process which the authors would like to share. Control takes the form of mutual control in a situation of communication and interpersonal interaction of learners and teachers. Self-control is a measure of responsibility of each participant of educational process. One of the necessary conditions of the lifelong education is the involvement of students in the evaluation of their educational activities on the basis of cognitive and behavioral self-control. The pedagogical conditions necessary to foster students' self-control are: the teacher involvement in the process; formation of students' self-assessment skills; students' involvement in various forms of mutual assessment; the formation of students' evaluative abilities; training and methodological support of the process of learning self-control.",2020,,,214,220

This raises major challenges for how to assess and report the state of lifelong learning in UNESCO Member States. It is in this context that this article critically evaluates the efforts to develop a composite index on lifelong learning. In addition, the author reviews the two leading surveys on adult education and learning, the OECD's Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) and the European Union's Adult Education Survey (AES). He examines their potential to provide a national picture of the state of lifelong learning, pointing out some fundamental shortcomings in these surveys and in the way their data have been classified. The present approach to data gathering on adult and lifelong learning, with its deep roots in the skills agenda, creates a reality of adult learning where the broad humanistic traditions of adult education become invisible. Analyses of the European and Canadian composite indexes of lifelong learning reveal serious problems using this approach. Not only must one question the underlying framework based on Jacques Delors' four pillars of learning, but also its practical use for directly assessing the impact of the various aspects of lifelong learning and education. A core argument in this article is that there is a need to broaden not only the indicators used to assess the state of lifelong learning, but also the approach to how outcomes are being understood and judged.",2019,65,2,295,317

To reevaluate facilitators of and barriers to pharmacists' participation in lifelong learning previously examined in a 1990 study. Methods. A survey instrument was mailed to 274 pharmacists who volunteered to participate based on a prior random sample survey. Data based on perceptions of facilitators and barriers to lifelong learning, as well as self- perception as a lifelong learner, were analyzed and compared to a similar 1990 survey. Results. The response rate for the survey was 88%. The top 3 facilitators and barriers to lifelong learning from the 2003 and the 1990 samples were: ( 1) personal desire to learn; ( 2) requirement to maintain professional licensure; and ( 3) enjoyment/ relaxation provided by learning as change of pace from the routine.'' The top 3 barriers were: ( 1) job constraints; ( 2) scheduling ( location, distance, time) of group learning activities; and ( 3) family constraints ( eg, spouse, children, personal). Respondents' broad self- perception as lifelong learners continued to be highly positive overall, but remained less positive relative to more specific lifelong learning skills such as the ability to identify learning objectives as well as to evaluate learning outcomes. Conclusions. Little has changed in the last decade relative to how pharmacists view themselves as lifelong learners, as well as what they perceive as facilitators and barriers to lifelong learning. To address factors identified as facilitators and barriers, continuing education ( CE) providers should focus on pharmacists' time constraints, whether due to employment, family responsibilities, or time invested in the educational activity itself, and pharmacists' internal motivations to learn ( personal desire, enjoyment), as well as external forces such as mandatory CE for relicensure.",2007,71,4,,

At present, Amur Oblast is of significant geopolitical importance, has an extensive natural resource potential. Support from the federal center has attracted large-scale projects in the region, many of which are under active implementation. The key investment projects include the commissioning of ground-based space infrastructure facilities at the Vostochny Cosmodrome, the construction of the Power of Siberia gas pipeline with technical support services, the construction of Russia's largest gas processing complex and gas chemical plant, commissioning of the Nizhne-Bureyskaya HPP, and others. In order to train engineers, AmSU built a differentiated and continuous system of vocational education of engineering personnel, including a general educational lyceum, an academic college, a university (bachelor, master, postgraduate) and additional professional education (retraining, advanced training). The organization of continuous training of engineering staff at the university is based on continuously developing innovative industries, introduction of a system of parallel education, provision of conditions for continuous professional development of students, formation of a flexible system of progressive professional and career growth in the school - university enterprise system. The objectives of the scientific and educational system of continuous training are: ensuring the continuity of knowledge, skills and labor activities in the school - university - enterprise system; ensuring the continued availability of a disciplinary institutional environment for obtaining relevant knowledge and skills; creating a system of continuous monitoring of the assessment of the content and quality of education in educational institutions; exchange of experience with scientific organizations and partner companies; providing opportunities for self-study; formation of personal motivation and innovative thinking; promotion of sustainable socio-economic development of the Far Eastern region, which turned out to be in the zone of a low demographic level, poor socio-economic development and cross-border risks and retention of youth in the region. The system of training engineering personnel within the framework of the concept of continuous training should be as close as possible to real engineering activity, and should be aimed at acquiring skills for solving complex technical problems through professional and creative approaches.

Upon leaving compulsory education, citizens still show an interest in geo-referenced information and they are able to associate the acquired knowledge with geospatial data. Today, acquiring geospatial thinking abilities is considered an outstanding goal of education. Formal thinking development encourages a student's cognitive abilities of different reasoning kinds that need to be fostered in order to succeed in lifelong learning. Cognitive processes associated with spatial thinking demand wide-ranging mental abilities. Basic cognitive skills are to observe, identify, relate and compare. Instruction should engage in complex cognitive abilities that lead to reasoning strategies, including classification, hierarchy and analogy, for problem framing and solving at varying scales and by using diverse geospatial tools. In this chapter, the capacities of spatial thinking and reasoning abilities are thus interrelated through geospatial information technologies.

Yet as a set of stages, the model involves a dilemma acknowledged by Kolb himself that it can proceed from either concrete experience or abstract conceptualisation. The paper builds on Kolb's insights about a possible solution to this dilemma in terms of how experiential learning is in some respects synonymous with but otherwise a more specific version of Alan Rogers' concept of informal lifelong education. On this basis, it adapts a 'lifecycle' perspective on how the direct or micro 'here and now' opportunities for constructive experiential learning ever potentially inform the larger or macro concept of lifelong learning - one also linked to the different formal modes as well as stages of education from schooling for youth through to adult education and later life learning. The paper further links various related lifelong learning challenges of harnessing direct life experience to the larger challenge of a typical knowledge-experience disconnect in modern formal education as well as society. Such a disconnect is exemplified by how lifelong informal learning often seems futile (and a lifetime of experience increasingly meaningless) in the face of the modern 'work-retirement-death' narrative still influential in a fast-changing and uncertain world.",2018,24,2,250,271

Good practices from Bulgarian libraries are presented, reflecting the increasing interest in lifelong learning and existing models of participation in such learning. An emphasis is placed on the opportunities that libraries are developing to promote lifelong learning. Information literacy courses provided by libraries are discussed, since libraries are the primary theoretical and empirical basis in the modern lifelong learning strategy. Since 2000, a number of strategic documents and programs have been adopted in Bulgaria to promote lifelong learning: Employment Strategy, National Strategy for Continuing Vocational Training, Operational Program Human Resources Development, National Strategy for lifelong learning (2014-2020). The National Lifelong Learning Strategy identifies four major priorities aimed at: implementing an educational approach that supports the development of all learners and contributes to building active individuals capable of coping with changes and uncertainty; improving the quality of education and training; providing an educational environment for equal access to lifelong learning, active social inclusion and active civil participation; stimulating education and training consistent with the needs of the economy and the changes in the labor market. In the Strategy, public libraries are among the cultural institutions that need to become an attractive multi-functional space - a place for reading, and for social events and contacts, to establish themselves as centers for informal study and self-study and a proactive factor in implementing learning initiatives for the benefit of the community. Work is needed to promote them as centers for the acquisition of digital competences and raising the cultural awareness of the population, providing learning and training opportunities for different age and target groups. The changing lifestyles and new challenges of a knowledge-based society also require a change in the educational environment. It is necessary to acquire knowledge and skills, so that learning becomes a continuous and natural process, accompanied by freedom of choice. In the activities of modern public libraries, it is necessary to focus on education and training in all its aspects, and to develop overall concepts of how they can support lifelong learning processes. The purpose of this study is to show how public libraries are a mediator in the acquisition and development of competencies by exposing the concept of the library as a partner in information literacy training in a lifelong learning perspective. Those practices in the Bulgarian public libraries that are related to information literacy, and are in the basis of the modern process of using and managing information resources, are analyzed. The study proves the hypothesis that information literacy is the key to lifelong learning.",2020,,,5067,5071

The declining health of North American adolescents is an urgent social concern; the most serious health issues (injury and violence, alcohol and other drug use, sexual risk-taking, poor diet) are connected to behaviors established in adolescence that persist into adulthood, and highlight the importance of establishing positive lifelong learning skills at this early age. Because of this growing concern over adolescent health, there has been increasing attention about the role of health education. Schools, as sites of formal learning, provide students with some skills to understand health information; however, external factors such as the media have a constant and continuing influence on adolescents' development of health understanding and behaviors. Indeed, commercial and entertainment media represents one of the most pervasive and prevailing settings for learning about health, and this includes web sites, magazines and television. These channels present powerful words and images which may influence adolescents' health education either directly through advertising or more subtly through health related behaviors of characters in video games and television shows. Yet, current formal methods of health education and promotion do not meet all the health and literacy needs of today's youth. We suggest that critical media literacy instruction represents an effective means of raising youth's awareness about the commercial purposes and persuasive techniques of mass media, and is a skill that can be carried throughout the life-course. The purpose of this chapter is to review the issues of health literacy and critical media literacy and how these attributes serve to promote youths' lifelong health learning needs. In doing so, we report on a research project that sought to investigate the opinions of grade ten students on the health component of health education curriculum and their views on the impact of larger societal influences on their health education. This paper reports specifically on student opinions concerning the media as one societal influence, as well as teachers' understandings of how the media affects students' health literacy. Data were collected from six student and four teacher focus groups and through surveys at four British Columbia (Canada) high schools on Vancouver Island and in the Lower Mainland. While many adolescents are aware that the media has an impact, most are not able to articulate clearly or critically how the media influence their health education.",2010,,,111,139

I explain this success based on a sociological institutionalist framework, arguing that lifelong learning has become a global norm in education policy. For this purpose, I conduct a quantitative study of 99 countries from 1996 to 2004, showing how the idea of lifelong learning has been disseminated by international organisations and how states have reacted to this development. I first outline the theoretical framework, highlighting in particular the crucial role of international organisations. In a further step, I present the data and methods. In the third part, I analyse the activities of several international organisations on lifelong learning. In the fourth step, I show how lifelong learning has spread, distinguishing the idea of lifelong learning and reforms linked to it. Fifth, as the quantitative analysis shows, international organisations like the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the European Union can explain a large part of dissemination when it comes to the idea of lifelong learning, but reforms are more dependent on national preconditions like the wealth of a country. In the conclusions, I sum up the article's main findings and outline further research areas linked to global diffusion processes.

This article investigates to what extent these supranational policy orientations have been translated into concrete national lifelong learning initiatives. Although European countries were not equally affected in terms of time and intensity by the rise in youth unemployment rates, the political responses from their governments shared a central focus on employability solutions to youth unemployment in lifelong learning policy reforms. Our comparative analysis shows how different lifelong learning policy initiatives managed to ceducationalise' a structural economic problem (i.e. youth unemployment) into an individual educational concern (i.e. lack of education and skills). We argue that the 'educationalisation' of youth unemployment through lifelong learning policies is a crisis management strategy, which has allowed governments to focus on the individual symptoms of the problem while avoiding offering solutions to the underlying structural causes of young people's poor labour market prospects.",2020,19,6,525,543

Attitude is also important in lifelong learning, and we call for clinical psychologists to adopt an intellectually humble stance and embrace a beginner's mind when approaching new knowledge and skills.

Recent reports suggest that the reality is less positive. This paper examines credit transfer in Scotland across three interfaces: between general and pre-vocational learning and vocational education and training (VET); within VET; and between VET and university degrees. It finds that credit transfer across the first two interfaces is limited; credit transfer at the third interface is more frequent but often problematic. One explanation is that the system is designed around credit accumulation rather than credit transfer; this, together with other features of the Scottish system, means that a degree of permeability is built in without the need for formal credit transfer. But a second explanation highlights the epistemological, institutional and political barriers to a unified system. The paper illustrates the importance of distinguishing among different types of credit system and the limitations of credit and qualifications frameworks as agents of change in the face of the institutional logics of national education and training systems. The capacity of cross-national credit systems to support mobility between national systems should not be exaggerated.",2013,39,3,366,384

Whereas the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) focused on primary education, the SDGs, through SDG 4 which is devoted to education, call on Member States to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. The inclusion of lifelong learning has awakened hopes for a stronger role of ALE in global education agendas and policies. In principle, the ten targets of SDG 4 open up clear possibilities for ALE. However, the author cautions that there is cause for scepticism that ALE, in particular human rights-based ALE, will receive more attention under the SDGs than it did under the MDGs. The article is structured into three sections. The first section traces the emergence of a rights-based approach to adult education as an international paradigm, with particular attention given to the role of UNESCO. The second section discusses how the rights-based approach to adult education has been contested by other actors in the field of education for development. In the final section, the author draws on recent empirical data to reflect on the role of ALE in the age of the SDGs.",2019,65,4,537,556

One hundred seven adults who reported engaging in an informal (out-of-school) science interest were interviewed as part of an ongoing series of studies of lifelong science learners. The goal of the study was to gain insight into how and why amateur astronomers and birders pursue their hobby, how their hobby developed, and what influenced that development. Educators may use this information to design programs that support informal science learning over the lifespan. Informed by self-determination theory, the characteristics, initial experiences, and interests, influences on continued development of science interests, sources of education, and benefits of engaging in a science hobby were explored. Results showed that most of the participants' lifelong science interests began in childhood and were influenced by events, resources, and family members. Members of both hobby groups reported that, as a result of their informal science interests, they were more knowledgeable about science, more knowledgeable about how science is done, possessed better observation skills, possessed more environmental awareness, and had opportunities to socialize and network with others with similar interests. The intersection of motivation and social capital derived from hobby engagement and lifelong science learning is discussed. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2017,54,3,412,433

In this context, competences have become a much discussed topic. Many documents were published by international organisations (UNESCO, World Bank, European Commission) which enumerated 21(st) century key competences. The field of learning theories has also experienced advances. Findings from neuroscience have promoted a new understanding of what really happens in the brain when we learn. At the same time, the fact that learning increasingly takes place in virtual communities led George Siemens (2004) to propose connectivism as a learning theory for the digital age. Similarly, Roberto Carneiro (2010) suggested a theory he called generativism which aims at describing collaborative learning with digital technologies and open educational resources. These theories might be better able to describe and explain lifelong learning than classical learning theories. In the field of digital technologies, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have recently received a great deal of attention. While Siemens suggested connectivist MOOCs (cMOOCs) as the ideal platform for connectivist learning, other forms of MOOCs were also developed. These MOOCs have spread at a breath-taking pace in the last few years, although it is far from clear to what extent they are based on principles from learning theories and really support learning. These developments will be presented and discussed with respect to their relevance for lifelong learning as an integral part of man's quest for meaning.",2015,50,1,41,59

The main hypothesis of the paper is that the participation of individuals in lifelong learning activities can in fact contribute to the economic growth of EU member states, in terms of reducing unemployment rates, increasing employability and overall economic competitiveness. The paper will be structured into three main parts. The first part will consist in a brief analysis of the main policies, programmes and strategies developed by the European Union in the field of lifelong learning, with special focus on the Europe 2020 Strategy, the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007-2013, and its successor, Erasmus+, as well as the Action Plan on Adult learning. The main objective of this analysis is to highlight the rationales for developing these initiatives in the context of the economic and social crisis that EU member states were facing at that time. Furthermore, the different types of lifelong learning will also be discussed (formal, nonformal and informal), both from the perspective of the European Union, as well as from the perspective of established authors in the field, such as Aspin, Jarvis and Bagnall. The second part of the paper focuses on studying the impact of the participation of adults in lifelong learning activities on earnings, employability and on the economy in general. To this end, I briefly review the results of several studies conducted by established authors in the field of lifelong learning, such as Dorsett, Lui, Weale, and Field regarding the economic impact of lifelong learning. This section will also include a brief discussion on several EU indicators related to lifelong learning, namely the participation rate of adults in education and training and the participation rate of adults in non-formal education and training, in order to create a more accurate picture on the participation of adults from EU member states in lifelong learning activities. The third and final section of the paper focuses on the role of national governments, as well as enterprises from EU member states in promoting lifelong learning as a means for combatting the negative effects of the economic and social crisis and for supporting economic growth in the years to come. To this end, aspects such as the role of national governments in supplying training opportunities for individuals who are currently unemployed in order to contribute to the reduction of unemployment rates, or the role of private enterprises in providing opportunities for the continuous professional development of their employees as a means for increasing their economic competitiveness will be discussed.",2016,,,11,18

Data for the research were acquired in field study, questionnaires in the virtual environment, and also the information from the Internet on the offer of music schools and institutions of non-formal education in the field of musical instrument play was used. Until 1950s and `60s the basics of the musical instrument play were acquired by children within their respective families, with the musicians of the elderly generation being their tutors. The aspirations to become a musician were sparked by family traditions, the high esteem of a musician as a personality by the local community, as well as the child's own willingness and perseverance in acquisition of an instrument's technique. The field-study interviews show musicians always referring to past experience and family tradition, namely, some member of the family already was a musician - granddad, dad, uncle - while granny or mother have been good singers. In the cultural environment of 1960s' countryside the two traditions - singing and music-making - are separated. The tradition of singing (both everyday and church) and its functioning in the local community was mainly sustained by the women, while playing the instruments was the part of the men. The children started to acquire the technique of a musical instrument roughly at the age of 610 years, while the full status of a musician within a community could be acquired by the aspiring player as early as at the age of 16, after having played for several times at some community events (an open-air dance zalumballe or an evening get-together,vecerinka in Latgale). During that period the playing skills were acquired without the ability to read score, based on musical memory. At the end of the 20th century and the early 21st most frequently the playing skills of an instrument (like violin, clarinet or accordion) are acquired attending some institution of music education, while both children and adults have an opportunity to learn the technique of some folk instrument (zither, harmonica, little drum, etc.) within some non-formal education setting or that of an amateur group. The present study analysis the factors either helping or hindering the continuation of the folk music- making tradition in the cultural environment of the 21st century, based on the opportunities for learning the techniques within the home-learning and life-long learning contexts.",2021,,,78,89

Learning to be: The world of education today and tomorrow, also known as the Faure report, is both philosophical and of a practical nature , aiming to lead to action . Faure and his collaborators offered governments, scholars and educational actors evocative concepts for a society-to-come, such as lifelong education (and later, lifelong learning), the learning society, international solidarity and personalised learning. Animating the report and its imaginary of lifelong learning is the ideal of the complete man , a modernist project to realise Man's destiny at the centre of the universe.

The findings indicate that positive relationships and positive correlations between learning satisfaction and continuing learning intention juxtapose, and satisfaction is positively correlated with continuing intention. Moreover, affective support moderates the three components significantly. The results of this research help expand the applicability of the TAM theory with more practical significance, conveying positive messages to the administrators, educators and lifelong learners in continuance of online learning, and thus maintaining retention, particularly in the post-pandemic new normal for the sustainability of higher education.",2023,15,3,,

Embracing transculturalism in education calls for integration of new concepts and approaches in lifelong learning that promote active participation, adaptation and interaction. To this end, this article examines transcultural lifelong learning as a holistic model for human development that involves inquiry, framing and positionality, all of which challenge our taken-for-granted frames of reference and expand our worldviews. The qualitative study presented here also explored how educators and learners develop cognitive, emotional and social qualities helping them to navigate culturally diverse environments. The findings demonstrate how engaging in dialogue and critical reflection that inform our actions might serve as a catalyst for positive social change and transformation. The study also reveals that implementing a holistic model of transcultural lifelong learning can create a more inclusive environment for lifelong learning without opposing cultural, national and ethnic binaries. In effect, a framework of transcultural lifelong learning has the potential of opening new horizons of cultural interaction and active participation in an increasingly diverse learning environment in the age of transnational migration.",2021,67,6,791,810

It is instead argued that a rapidly changing economic situation requires that individuals undertake sustained periods of learning related to their presumed constant occupational mobility. This model assumes a low-skill, low-productivity economy which has little need for a skilled workforce. Once one assumes that a high-skill productive economy is desirable, then the case for sustained initial vocational education, followed by further appropriate skill development, becomes irresistible. The Learning and Skills Act and UK government policy is evaluated in the light of these arguments and appears to concede too much to the advocates of multiple episodes of training in a low-skill context.",2003,29,2,239,252

These types of renewal needs require developing updated instructional practices that put a premium on adaptability to the emerging requirements of present society, such as cooperation skills, and the ability to critically select, acquire and use knowledge. However, the Israeli university instruction is criticized for not coping with these new challenges, while continuing to exemplify the traditional instruction, based on objectivist philosophical assumptions. In order to overcome this critical inadequacy between current educational goals and instructional methods, the LLAF consortium (including 16 members from 8 countries) is collaborating to create a curricular reform for lifelong learning (LLL) in teachers' education, health care and other applied fields. This project was launched December 2013 and aims to achieve its objectives by developing and piloting models for training students in LLL and promoting meaningful learning activities in teachers' education that could integrate knowledge with the personal transferable skills. LLAF has created a practical guide for teachers containing updated pedagogical strategies based on the constructivist approach for learning, arranged along Delors' (1996) four theoretical 'pillars' of education for the future: 1. Learning to know - mastering learning tools rather than acquisition of structured knowledge. 2. Learning to do - equipping people for the types of work needed now and in the future including innovation and adaptation of learning to future work environments. 3. Learning to live together, and with others - peacefully resolving conflict, discovering other people and their cultures, fostering community capability, individual competence and capacity, economic resilience, and social inclusion. 4. Learning to be - education contributing to a person's complete development: mind and body, intelligence, sensitivity, aesthetic appreciation and spirituality. Teachers' educators will be able to choose from a myriad of different strategies to embed in their current curriculum with the goal of promoting LLL. This presentation will introduce the four pillar framework, several strategies and examples pertinent to teachers' education will be presented.",2015,,,2132,2132

In this article, we study how dispositions about learning as measured in PIAAC (2012) vary between countries.

We improve the cross-sectional research design by controlling attitudes among adults for attitudes collected among primary school students, making use of diff-in-diff and pseudo-panel-techniques. Overall, we find that strong external differentiation mechanisms, in particular tracking students at a young age and making extensively use of grade retention, are associated with less positive attitudes towards learning among adults.

The analysis uses multilevel modelling. It also relies on mapping lifelong learning policies in Bulgaria through a thematic content analysis. The article argues that the misbalances for highly educated people on the labour market mirror structural problems in the economy and the educational system. The argument is reflected in the historical and structural embeddedness of graduates' education-job mismatches and the lifelong learning policies applied to overcome this. The results show that the extent of vertical education-job mismatch depends on the different profiles of higher education institutions and professional fields; they also demonstrate different ways in which the embeddedness approach could help shed new light on, and critically assess, lifelong learning policies.

However, a large portion of medical education happens outside of classrooms, in authentic clinical contexts. Therefore, this article discusses recent developments in research regarding fostering active learning in clinical contexts. Self-regulated, lifelong learning in medical educationClinical contexts are much more complex and flexible than classrooms, and therefore require a modified approach when fostering active learning. Recent efforts have been increasingly focused on understanding the more complex subject of supporting active learning in clinical contexts. One way of doing this is by using theory regarding self-regulated learning (SRL), as well as situated learning, workplace affordances, self-determination theory and achievement goal theory. Combining these different perspectives provides a holistic view of active learning in clinical contexts. Entry to practice, vocational training and continuing professional developmentResearch on SRL in clinical contexts has mostly focused on the undergraduate setting, showing that active learning in clinical contexts requires not only proficiency in metacognition and SRL, but also in reactive, opportunistic learning. These studies have also made us aware of the large influence one's social environment has on SRL, the importance of professional relationships for learners, and the role of identity development in learning in clinical contexts. Additionally, research regarding postgraduate lifelong learning also highlights the importance of learners interacting about learning in clinical contexts, as well as the difficulties that clinical contexts may pose for lifelong learning. However, stimulating self-regulated learning in undergraduate medical education may also make postgraduate lifelong learning easier for learners in clinical contexts. In this article the authors review developments in supporting active learning in medical education with particular emphasis on translating the ideas from a variety of important theories to the clinical context.",2018,52,1,34,44

It is a breakthrough attempt to amalgamate the regular learning program with the job training. The LLP can be interpreted as an extension of the Lisbon Strategy which pursues to facilitate the knowledge-based economy. The LLP is the key to employment, economic success and allowing people to participate fully in society in a rapidly changing world. Other merits of the LL of EU comprise a more integrated interdisciplinary approach and a more vigorous stance on the mutual interaction between the LL and conventional education system. The Korean government has implemented LL in a hierarchic way, thus, it may be required to induce the participation of stakeholder of local communities. Another feature may be the affluent corporate sector and impoverished private sector in delivering LL. It may be noticeable that the wedge between public and private education institutions has increased all the way which hardly contribute for alleviating the personal distribution of income and social exclusion. It may be a due time for Korea to reverse the megatrend of predominance of private sector in LL by rebalancing the available funds between the public and private ones. It may be worthwhile for Korea to capture new attributes of the LLP of the EU which reinforces an automatic feedback system between regular academic courses and job training ones by reflecting economic, social and environmental issues simultaneously.

What all countries in the E. U. share, however, is a common international context of rapidly changing globalised economies, communications and human cultural perspectives, where knowledge is a key resource, and where the need for skilled workforces and active citizens is making increasing demands on education at all levels. Primarily, lifelong learning is expected to deliver competence development and labor market-related qualifications within and outside enterprises as part of human resource development to sustain economic growth. It is also expected to contribute to the maintenance of democratic values and institutions, and to societal and personal development, as well as reducing development gaps between rural and urban areas. Adopting a lifelong learning approach has important implications for national policy-making. Public policy has to create the frameworks legislative, governance, financial, institutional, learning, informational, qualifications and regulatory to motivate adults to engage in structured learning. In addition, this requires collateral policies in related areas such as employment, welfare, rural development and poverty reduction and monitoring and evaluation of policy impact across many ministries and agencies in order to reduce development gaps between rural and urban areas.

In addition, teachers are faced with the challenge of preparing students for the workforce and lifelong learning. One emerging approach for addressing both these challenges is that of heutagogy, or self-determined learning. This paper discusses the rising demand for lifelong learning skills and the role that heutagogy can play in supporting students in developing self-directed and lifelong learning skills. Specifically, the paper presents a case study of a higher education institution that has introduced heutagogy, using interviews with programme leaders/instructors to investigate how a college in Israel incorporated heutagogy into their master's education programmes. Case study results reveal that there are challenges in incorporating heutagogy (eg, difficulty for students in adopting the approach), but once adopted, students preferred learning in a self-determined way. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic? Lifelong learning skills are critical to student employability, and there is a need for exploring new theories and approaches for developing these skills. The current pandemic has forced traditional learning into the online space, requiring more self-directed learning skills in learners. Heutagogy has been identified as a net-centric teaching and learning theory for online learning. What this paper adds Positions heutagogy for use in traditional and online classroom settings in order to develop learners' self-directed and lifelong learning skills. Explores the pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy continuum and its use as an instructional strategy. Presents a case study of a higher education institution that has implemented self-determined learning.

Nowadays, there is a need for a flexible, efficient, universal and lifelong education. Lifelong learning is fully integrated into our society and, from the student point of view, it is very different from regular learning. Among these differences there is the maturity of students, the fact that the domains of interest are much broader, the way how learning occurs at different depths, the fact that the topics to study may be related to work, family and leisure, and that students have little availability due to their necessity to conciliate home, work, leisure and learning. Lifelong learning requires personalised models that adapt to students' needs and constraints, but lifelong learners keep suffering from models that are adapted neither to their necessities, nor to the needs of society.

J,"Lester, S",,,"Lester, Stan",,Sequential schooling or lifelong learning? International frameworks through the lens of English higher professional and vocational education,EDUCATION AND TRAINING,,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to review three international frameworks, including the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), in relation to one country's higher professional and vocational education system. Design/methodology/approach - The frameworks were examined in the context of English higher work-related education, and areas of mismatch identified. These were investigated to identify the extent to which they were due to weaknesses in the national system or to limiting assumptions contained in the frameworks. Findings - Assumptions based on stages of education are problematic in the context of lifelong higher and professional education, while more open, lifelong-learning oriented assumptions can be too skeletal to aid comparisons between systems of initial vocational education and training. Particular problems are identified with assumptions contained in the ISCED that do not reflect the reality of professional education. Practical implications - International frameworks need to take account of patterns of learning that take place outside of formal institutions and throughout life, but which lead to equivalent outcomes. Nevertheless, it is not adequate to substitute assumptions based only on the level of achievement. Social implications - The assumptions underpinning the ISCED in particular mean that equivalent achievements in different systems can be classified differently, leading to under-reporting of individual achievements, a lack of comparability in international statistics, and potential for policy distortion. Originality/value - The paper builds on the work of Hippach-Schneider et al. by providing additional evidence, from a different national context, for issues relating to the ISCED in the context of higher professional and vocational education, and extends this analysis to the two major European frameworks.",2018,60,2,213,224

Education is the key to converting knowledge and experience into practical actions, their analysis and application. It plays a key role in the synthesis of new knowledge into research and innovation. Such thoughts on education were expressed in the resolution of the sixth World Education Congress in 2011. Today, when world education forums are widely discussing how schools can better organise the learning process, when ambitious long-term reforms are being implemented in the Latvian education system-the transition to competency-based educational content and teaching methods-it is essential to assess current situation and to bring innovative methods and techniques to our teachers' own learning process. The new knowledge and experience teachers gain through lifelong learning, through their experience and the understanding of how to share it, can be presented and guided by such methods and techniques that enrich a teacher's emotional and intellectual function. My own research has confirmed my belief that for a teacher to be confident and capable enough to help her students discover the joy of learning and gain new knowledge through the process of education, that teacher must herself have the experience of active learning, insight, and personal growth through the learning process. The author has selected a number of methods and techniques for lifelong learning based on the methods and techniques developed by a number of education researchers (Kolb, 1984; Koke, 1999; Stueck, 2010; Vedins, 2011; Scurkova, 2016; Robinson, 2013; Amonasvili, 2017), and on her own experience of leading and developing a professional lifelong education programme for teachers.

In lifelong learning, where learning opportunities are diverse and reach beyond institutional boundaries, it becomes even more complex to decide on a learning path. However, efficient and effective lifelong learning requires that learners can make well informed decisions. Drawing on principles of self-organisation and indirect social interaction, this article suggests solving the problem by analysing the paths followed by learners and feeding this information back as advice to learners facing navigational decisions. This article starts by introducing the principles of self-organisation and indirect social interaction. It describes how we expect the use of indirect social interaction using collaborative filtering to enhance effectiveness (completion rates and amount of progress) and efficiency (time taken to complete) in lifelong learning. The effects were tested in a controlled experiment, with the results showing effects on effectiveness though not on efficiency. The study shows that indirect feedback is a promising line of enquiry for navigational support in lifelong learning. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2007,49,3,781,793

In this context, the goal of this research is to test the influence of formal e-learning on estimating employment status. The research made use of a sample of 595 citizens in 2007 and 1,742 citizens in 2011, using microdata from Eurostat's Adult Education Survey (AES) implemented by the Spanish Statistical Office [Instituto Nacional de Estadistica] (INE) in Spain. Controlling for socio-demographics and formal education-level information, multiple binary logistic and ordinal regression models on formal education activities are used to check the separate effects of independent variables and demonstrate that Spanish people who have done formal lifelong e-learning activities are more likely to have an employment contract: i) in 2007, before the start of the economic crisis, for all individuals; ii) in 2011, during the economic crisis, for all individuals; iii) in 2011, for individuals with any level of computer literacy; iv) in 2011, for individuals whose highest education level is primary, secondary, or post-secondary non-tertiary; and v) in 2011, for individuals having more stable employment contracts, understood as a combination of duration (temporary, permanent), and working hours (part-time, full-time). Consequently, after inferential judgements based on the empirical results, it is shown that one of the most important factors for estimating employability in times of economic crisis has to do with lifelong e-learning. Moreover, formal e-learning activities can be a strategy for obtaining better job stability.",2017,18,6,261,287

Beginning in 2011, an optional continuing medical education (CME) activity was added. Objectives: As a part of a CME activity option for the LLSA, a survey was used to determine the relevancy of the LLSA readings and the degree to which medical knowledge garnered by the LLSA activity would modify clinical care. Methods: Survey results from the 2011 LLS ACME activity were reviewed. This survey was composed of seven items, including questions about the relevancy of the readings and the impact on the physician's clinical practice. The questions used a 5-point Likert scale and data underwent descriptive analyses. Results: There were 2841 physicians who took the LLSA test during the study period, of whom 1354 (47.7%) opted to participate in the 2011 LLSA CME activity. All participants completed surveys. The LLSA readings were reported to be relevant to the overall clinical practice of Emergency Medicine (69.6% strongly relevant, 28.1% some relevance, and 2.3% little or no relevance), and provided information that would likely help them change their clinical practices (high likelihood 38.8%, some likelihood 53.0%, little or no change 8.2%). Conclusions: The LLSA component of the ABEM MOC program is relevant to the clinical practice of Emergency Medicine. Through this program, physicians gain new knowledge about the practice of Emergency Medicine, some of which is reported to change physicians' clinical practices.

Extraordinary security measures, health restrictions, and social isolation left hardly any aspect of daily life untouched. One area that underwent major changes was education, whose cornerstones and foundations were challenged as schools and universities around the world were forced to close their doors to prevent the spread of the virus. In this article, the reasons resilience and agility are critical to achieving social justice, human rights, and the United Nations Sustainability goals (SDG) in the post-pandemic era are studied. It is also argued that the role of education needs to be redesigned to be resilient and agile and to ensure lifelong learning. In addition, a post-pandemic quality agenda is the focus of the article. Some of the emerging quality dimensions are empathy, satisfaction, well-being, the social dimensions of learning, and their impact at the nano, micro, meso, and macro levels. This article was prepared as part of a systematic literature review based mainly on official reports from organizations working in this field worldwide. The author selected examples from ongoing discourse and debate about the challenges in this field in addition to examples from the author's research, experiences, and perspectives. In summary, questions regarding educational landscapes may be the same, but in the context of post-pandemic and resilient agile education for lifelong learning to meet the SDGs and the new social contract for education, the answers to the questions of why, who, when, what, and at what levels will be different. It is time not just to talk, but to act. Each of us can and must commit to the new social contract.

The main barrier to implementing Education 4.0 in schools is that teachers have not been trained for it. Given the advances and new resources of the technological field, teacher preparation will be insufficient if it focuses on technological skills but does not incorporate the necessary dispositions for lifelong learning. Universities have the ethical imperative to update teacher education so teachers can become lifelong learners. The objective of this study was to understand whether practice-based curricula offer opportunities to promote lifelong learning tendencies. We used a sequential explanatory method. Quantitative and qualitative instruments were applied to pre-service teachers (survey: n = 231, semi-structured interviews: n = 8), and causal and descriptive approaches were supported by a structural equation model and constant comparative method, respectively. Data triangulation confirmed and added depth to the relationship found. Practice opportunities provided by teacher educators in learning activities and assessment tasks promote curiosity, motivation, perseverance, and self-learning regulation, when they are (i) systematic; (ii) relevant to the classroom work; (iii) presented with clear instructions and effective rubrics; (iv) accompanied with feedback focused on the task, soliciting reflection, and performed by peers and teacher educators in a trustworthy environment.

I argued that the lifelong learning system under the global forces of capitalism, as per the Asian experience in the 2000s, can be apart of a knowledge economy itself, not a toot of it, and in this sense, a knowledge economy sets the conditions of a lifelong learning system as an embryo of its attributes.",2007,8,3,478,486

The field of e-learning has an impressive literature focusing on tools that support teaching, learning and assessment activities. The missing element for several years has been providing an integrated approach dealing with issues relating to pedagogy, technology and learning. The design and delivery of formative assessment opportunities has been the focus of the author's research for several years, in conjunction to emphasis on how formative feedback can be supported in e-learning scenarios. For more than ten years several case studies have been investigated with respect to how feedback is perceived in distance education and the identification of key differences between instructors and learners. This paper discusses the above issues with the aid of lifelong learning scenarios. Emphasis is given on presenting tools that have been developed to support the entire learning process from its early curriculum design stages to the delivery of specific feedback on various learning activities. The main contribution of the paper is through a framework for providing customised and personalised feedback based on a semi-automated mechanism supported by learning management systems.

Teachers post assignments, lecture notes, exams, competitions, and also evaluate students and communicate with them via Edmodo. E-Learning makes it possible to learn about information and communication technologies. Applications such as Edmodo Classroom 2.0 makes it possible to learn even outside the classroom. These applications are viewed as solutions to insufficient class hours and issues that are experienced within the class. In the digital age, new generations tend to maintain different opinions and also different learning capabilities. It's important that we care about how this generation can learn and respond to diverse teaching methods for the sake of their future. Online activities that support a learning outside classroom is similar to other learning practices. Life-long learning is important for building the future of our education. It is a process that's alternative to formal education It has no place and no time.

The author tries to determine the impact of raising qualifications for the development of the silver economy. To achieve the goal of the work, Eurostat data regarding the situation in Poland and Spain against the EU average are used. It is worth noting that continuing education dictated by the requirements of the labor market, in the case of older people, brings additional benefits. On the one hand, participation in educational programs and projects gives a sense of social inclusion, and on the other hand, learning helps to acquire skills of using modern devices to preserve the independence of older people.

This study's purpose was to determine factors that influence physician engagement with practice data to advance competence and drive practice change. Methods: A practice-based, pan-Canadian survey was administered to three physician subspecialties: psychiatrists (Psy), radiation oncologists (RO), and general surgeons (GS). The survey was distributed through national specialty society membership lists. The survey assessed factors that influence the use of data for practice improvement and orientation to lifelong learning, using the Jefferson Scale of Physician Lifelong Learning (JeffSPLL). Linear regression was used to model the relationship between the outcome variable frequency of data use and independent predictors of continuous leaming to improving practice. Results: A total of 305 practicing physicians (Psy = 203, RO = 53, GS = 49) participated in this study. Most respondents used data for practice improvement (n = 177, 61.7%; Psy = 115, 40.1%; RO = 35; 12.2%; GS = 27, 9.4%) and had high orientation to lifelong learning (JeffSPLL mean scores: Psy = 47.4; RO = 43.5; GS = 45.1; Max = 56). Linear regression analysis identified significant predictors of data use in practice being: frequency of assessing learning needs, helpfulness of data to improve practice, and frequency to develop learning plans. Together, these predictors explained 42.9% of the variance in physicians' orientation toward integrating accessible data into practice (R-2 = 0.426, P < .001). Discussion: This study demonstrates an association between practice data use and perceived data utility, reflection on learning needs and learning plan development.

Research confirms that the development of generic skills that underpin effectiveness and adaptability in graduates is highly context-dependent and is shaped by the discipline within which these skills are conceptualised, valued and taught. This places the responsibility for generic skills enhancement clearly within the remit of global medical education. IMPLICATIONS Many factors will influence the skill set with which students begin their medical training and experience at entry needs to be taken into account. Learning and teaching environments enhance effective skill development through active learning, teaching for understanding, feedback, and teacher-student and student-student interaction. Medical curricula need to provide students with opportunities to practise and develop their generic skills in a range of discipline-specific contexts. Curricular design should include explicit and integrated generic skills objectives against which students' progress can be monitored. Assessment and feedback serve as valuable reinforcements of the professed importance of generic skills to both learner and teacher, and will encourage students to self-evaluate and take responsibility for their own skill development. The continual need for students to modify their practice in response to changes in their environment and the requirements of their roles will help students to develop the ability to transfer these skills at transition points in their training and future careers. CONCLUSIONS If they are to take their place in an ever-changing profession, medical students need to be competent in the skills that underpin lifelong learning. Only then will the doctors of the future be well placed to adapt to changes in knowledge, update their practice in line with the changing evidence base, and continue to contribute effectively as societal needs change.",2012,46,1,120,128

However, research in Slovenia shows that many lose their enthusiasm for these activities when they leave university and enter professional practice. In Slovenia, whilst geography teachers have a sound undergraduate education, few partake in postgraduate study and, in the last decade, there has been a decrease in the number of geography teachers who engage with continuing professional education. High teaching workloads and costs are seen as barriers to more formal types of continuing professional development. Thus, most learning occurs via informal and opportunistic learning activities. However, the extent and effects of engagement in these types of learning is hard to measure. Given the current situation, there is a need to promote a culture in schools that provides geography teachers with both encouragement and incentives to enhance their professional skills through further learning.",2010,34,1,53,58

Evidence for Europe from PIAAC,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION,,"Empirical evidence suggests that educational attainment nurtures people's social outcomes and promotes active participation in society and stability. However, it is unclear to what extent other types of human capital also correlate with social outcomes. Hence, we explored the opportunity offered by the PIAAC survey through its provision of information on educational attainment, observed individual key skills proficiency, and participation in adult education and training (adult lifelong learning). We therefore studied the association between these human capital variables and social outcomes, and more specifically interpersonal trust and participation in volunteering activities. Results revealed that these social outcomes were affected not only by the formal qualification obtained, determined by the education variable, but also throughout the life-cycle. Indeed, education and training when undertaken during adult life have a significant impact, especially on volunteering. The fact that the skill proficiency also plays a significant role is extremely relevant, as skills are more likely to change over the life-cycle, either in a positive or negative way. Whilst the formal education received is constant after exiting the educational system, skills reflect competences more accurately: first, because those with the same level of education may have different skill levels because of differences in the quality of education or ability; second, because skills can vary over time. For example, they may increase with work experience or informal education, or decrease as a result of depreciation and ageing. These findings suggest that social outcomes are prone to be affected by many factors other than formal education, suggesting that policy makers can implement recommendations even after formal education has been completed.",2017,52,2,217,231

The current research problem illustrates that expanded and emerging professional development scenarios require new pedagogical designs for empowering lifelong learners to harness the affordances of the web across both formal and informal contexts and practices.

The present study explores current experiences, views and preferences towards training and education in palliative care among GPs, palliative home-care professionals and professionals from organizations who provide training and education. Methods: Five focus groups were brought together in Belgium, with a total of 29 participants, including members of the three categories mentioned above. They were analysed using a constant comparison method. Results: The analysis revealed that undergraduate education and continuing medical education (CME) while in practice, is insufficient to prepare GPs for their palliative work. Workplace learning (WPL) through collaboration with specialized palliative home-care nurses seems to be a valuable alternative. Conclusions: The effectiveness of undergraduate education might be enhanced by adding practical experience. Providers of continuing medical education should look to organize interactive, practice-based and interprofessional sessions. Therefore, teachers need to be trained to run small group discussions. In order to optimize workplace learning, health care professionals should be trained to monitor each other's practice and to provide effective feedback.

Nevertheless, society dynamics challenge more often than not, the realm of policies and academics throwing their way outcomes that emerge as natural responses to various societal hurdles which the individual faces in the 21st century. That is the case of informal learning which we consider to have the highest potential of creating innovative learning resources and tools that best address the learning needs for lifelong learning at this particular moment due to its specificity and keeping in mind the setbacks of the formal educational system, the changes and challenges brought about by the digital era as well as the shifting paradigms of employment.

Thus the alternatives RCAD proposes are being designed as MOOC since the initiators consider that this category of learning tool (MOOC) best responses to informal learning needs since learning at one's own pace, in the setting that best suits the learner without the constrains of a formal, pre-defined background ensures an authentic development and an authentic learning experiences especially for adults who have to meet the challenges of an active social and professional life. At the present moment the organization has designed a MOOC English as Foreign Language Course for independent use targeted at beginner and intermediate learners. The Brown Bear's Company (BBC) is a historical reenactment association established in 2014 with the support of ABI Foundation. The Company promotes the concept of living history as informal leaning through reenactment activities, events, craft workshops that bring to life civilian and military living in the Medieval Period. The trainers of the Brown Bear's Company developed their presentations and reenactment sessions as informal learning for they consider building up skills a mean of cognitive development both basic as well as complex, aimed at relevant details for the process of learning about common historical, cultural heritage and immaterial patrimony.",2018,,,2172,2176

Design: Analytic survey. Management of hypertension was chosen as an appropriate topic to assess guideline adherence. An updated version of a previously validated questionnaire was mailed to the participants for self-completion. Setting: Private primary care practices in southern Ontario. Participants: A random sample of 48 MU graduates and 48 UT graduates, stratified for year of graduation (1974 to 1985) and sex, who were in family or general practice in Ontario; 87% of the eligible subjects in each group responded. Main outcome measures: Overall and component-specific scores; analysis was blind to study group. Results: The overall mean scores were 56 (68%) of a possible 82 for the MU graduates and 51 (62%) for the UT graduates (difference between the means 5, 95% confidence interval 1.9 to 8.2; p < 0.01). Multivariate linear regression analysis of seven factors that might affect questionnaire scores revealed that only the medical school was statistically significant (p < 0.01). The MU graduates had significantly higher mean scores than the UT graduates for two components of the questionnaire: knowledge of recommended blood pressures for treatment (p < 0.05) and successful approaches to enhance compliance (p < 0.005). The trends were similar for the other components but were not significant. Conclusions: The graduates of a problem-based, self-directed undergraduate curriculum are more up to date in knowledge of the management of hypertension than graduates of a traditional curriculum.",1993,148,6,969,976

Although researchers have often found considerable inequalities in participation by age, as well as strongly articulated attitudinal differences, there have so far been only a handful of studies that have explored these patterns through the perspective of generational formations. The paper is primarily conceptual, exploratory and reflective, setting out a number of approaches to the concept of generations, most of which derive largely from debates with the ghost of Karl Mannheim; it then considers how these concepts of generation have been applied to understandings of educational inequalities in recent research in Germany and the Nordic nations. It then examines the dynamics of inter-generational relations in learning, drawing on research undertaken as part of the Teaching and Learning Research Programme. The paper argues that although inter-generational dynamics are a relatively neglected dimension of Anglophone research on life chances and learning, there is a strong case for understanding their dual roles in both inequality and cohesion. It concludes by outlining some themes and areas for further investigation in the future.",2013,61,1,109,119

The analysis of both Russian and foreign studies allowed putting forward the hypothesis that women and men may have different approaches to the construction of a lifelong learning educational path. The purpose of this study is to assess the parameters of women's and men's involvement in lifelong learning, including the goals and sources of funding, in order to identify similarities and gender asymmetry of lifelong learning path in Russia. The data of the sample survey of population involvement in lifelong learning, conducted by Rosstat in 2020, show that women and men's age profiles are similar, but their levels of involvement in different types of lifelong learning are not the same: men participate more actively in non-formal education, and women - in self-education. The current segregation of additional studies for qualification and field generally reflects the existing sectoral and occupational segregation in employment. At the same time, both women and men rarely associate their additional training with the expanded career opportunities, which may indicate the absence of a full-fledged system of vertical professional mobility based on the human potential growth. Our calculations show that employers more often invite men than women to take additional education and, accordingly, women more often than men pay for it themselves. Women with young children experience particular difficulties in participating in non-formal education and more often than others have to pay for themselves. This, in our view, contributes to the formation of gender inequality of opportunities for participation in lifelong learning, which makes it important to consider the gender factor in state programs of lifelong learning development in order to maximize its contribution to the human potential reproduction.",2021,14,4,169,184

It marks an important step forward as a high-profile publication trying to radically re-think the challenge of sustainable development and revisit what it means to develop as human beings interconnected within earth systems. This article provides a critical reading of the report, and human development literature more widely, in assessing the role of lifelong learning in educating for just transitions, which it broadly understands as the transformation of all social systems, including economic systems, to bring them back into balance with earth systems in which they are embedded. The report maintains its trademark human development lens which has characterised the series since their inception in 1990. It prioritises consideration of capabilities, agency and values as central to the challenge, and opens up a discussion of how we need to change our understandings, values and actions, including what it means to be human, in order to effect just transitions towards sustainability. However, as the authors demonstrate, the report falls short of considering the lifelong learning challenge inherent and central to just transitions. The authors argue that the pressing challenge of responding to the climate emergency requires a richer understanding of how humans learn throughout their life course. In so doing, this article is a contribution to both the literature on education and human development, and the growing body of literature in the field of adult education and sustainability.",2021,67,5,637,658

This can be achieved only if the workforce is qualified, skilled and flexible, thus it is clear that an emphasis should also be put on staff development. Development can be achieved in many ways; one of them is through lifelong learning supported by universities. This paper presents e-learning study materials developed by academics in the Department of Machine Design (DMD) at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering (FME) at the University of West Bohemia (UWB). The study materials focus on design projects from industrial practice. There are several projects and each one focuses on a specific machine. The outputs from all the projects are e-learning pdf files. These study materials contain all the important information which a designer usually comes into contact with, for example: drawing documentation, a 3D model, calculation reports, welding technology, etc. These study materials were developed primarily for full-time students at the Department of Machine Design to rectify their lack of practical knowledge. When the project was completed it became clear that these study materials could also be applied in the context of lifelong learning. The Institute of Lifelong Learning at the University of West Bohemia offers courses and training for companies and the general public. The courses for employees tend to be narrowly focused on an area specified by the company. Public courses are not designed for training individuals. Open courses are periodically arranged in the spring and autumn of each year to train groups. Due to the narrow specialization of engineers who work in industrial practice, there is a loss of continuity in education in other areas of mechanical engineering. The elearning study materials are comprehensive and include knowledge from different fields of engineering. In a new job, these study materials can help an employee to study the problematics before starting work in another field, and possibly even shorten in-company learning. Study materials can also help to a large extent during a job interview.

It aspires to create a European Space of DIALOGUE between ULLL researchers, practitioners and policy makers. By reinforcing this knowledge alliance, the project will improve the transfer of educational research into the field of professional practice in ULLL as well as the thematic involvement of practitioners in research, which will support the collective production of knowledge and reinforce the evolution of lifelong learning ( LLL). Approach The research-practice link is explored in four theme groups identified as highly relevant topics on the adult education agenda: Access and Progression, for flexible learning pathways and enhanced participation of adults in LLL Learning and Guidance for effective LLL guidance systems New Media for innovative solutions in teaching and learning methods and flexible access to programmes Quality for a high quality LLL offer The European Space of Dialogue and practitioner-researcher cooperation are reached by involving two representatives (a practitioner and a researcher) of each partner institution in the project. Each of these two institutional partners has joined a different thematic working group (TWG). Like that, they will benefit from different insights of at least two working groups when discussing DIALOGUE. This practical experience of the researcher-practitioner cooperation in the project is supplemented by different research activities: 1. Collection of best case practices of researcher-practitioner cooperation (transfer or research results to practice and practice's contribution to research) and of national overviews 2. Production of SWOT and Network Analyses: The identified case studies will be analysed in detail in terms of (U) LLL practitioner-research cooperation and of the different research cultures and underlying concepts of research and learning cultures. The role of LLL networks to overcome barriers will be investigated. 3. Formulation of multilevel recommendations: Based on the results, partners will identify regional, national and European recommendations to strengthen the ULLL research-practice links User and target groups DIALOGUE is highly relevant for ULLL and adult education (AE) researchers and practitioners in their teaching, researching and planning activities, for ULLL networks as fora for exchange, and for social partners and policy-makers in view of their catalysing roles. The target audience is clearly the learner, with special focus on the LLL adult learner, who will benefit from an improved LLL offer.

The almost unopposed return of lifelong learning to the policy agenda demands an analysis of the dynamics of what is now generally understood as late modernity. This paper examines current theories of late modern societies in terms of their implications for understanding the pre-eminence of lifelong learning. It argues that late modernity is the period of social development in which lifelong learning becomes the necessary condition of survival. Societies, organizations and individuals have to learn in order to survive in the lifelong learning society. In particular the focus is upon the implications of new theoretical perspectives for the formulation of key research questions about adult and continuing education in the lifelong learning society. The first section addresses key theoretical perspectives in the literature of late modernity. Attention then turns to issues concerning the societal organization of social allocation and the distribution of opportunities to participate in lifelong learning. This is followed by a discussion of the emergence of learning organization as specific arenas for the location of lifelong learning in late modern societies. Attention is focused subsequently on the biographical competencies which individuals require in order to manage their learning careers and participation in lifelong learning.",1999,49,2,79,90

This study examined the notion of lifelong learning as a cultural thesis describing modes of life for producing (future) citizens through an analysis of documents from the OECD and South Korea. Along with other OECD member countries, South Korea is deeply involved in a contemporary discourse about educational reform that includes lifelong learning. At the center of this discussion in South Korea, there is an increasing amount of attention being given to comparison, standardization, and school accountability. School accountability in relation to student achievement aims to make citizens more intelligible; it also aims for effective transformations of national education systems and greater productivity and competitiveness nationally. However, (inter)national discourses about lifelong learning are not neutral elements that explain the present and plans for the future, but systems of reason associated with the construction of a particular mode of life for students. Findings of the study suggested that the lifelong learning discourse by the OECD and South Korea embody a particular category for creating particular images and narratives of students and citizens. National boundaries of education systems are now being crossed because of supranational governance of education. Examining the OECD and its influence can draw attention to who the student and the citizen should be and who is excluded from the space of success. By exploring these issues at national and international levels, the study presented how the discourses of the OECD and South Korea are assembled and connected.",2020,41,4,623,637

J,"Elger, D; Russell, P",,,"Elger, D; Russell, P",,The virtual campus: a new place for (lifelong) learning?,AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION,,"In the early spring of 2001 a collection of German universities founded a virtual faculty of architecture, which was named Liquid Campus. Current thinking about future forms of education in the field of architecture combined with over 4 years of experience with net-based design studios, led to questions about the future of existing universities, their buildings, and their use. This problem was put to 43 students in the form of a design exercise to create a place for a virtual university. In the current situation, in which the administration of knowledge is more and more located on the internet, and even the so-called meeting places themselves can be virtualised through the help of video-conference-software, the exercise was to design a virtual campus in the framework and to carry out this design work in a simulation of distributed practice. Initial criticism of the project came from the students in that exemplary working methods were not described, but left for the students to discover on their own. The creation of a concept for the Liquid Campus meant that the participants had to imagine working in a world without the face to face contacts that form the basis (at present) of personal interaction. Additionally, the assignment to create or design possible links between the real and the virtual was not an easy task for students who normally design and plan real physical buildings. Even the tutors had difficulties in producing focused constructive criticism about a virtual campus; in effect, the virtualisation of the university leads to a distinctive blurring of its boundaries. The project was conducted using the pedagogical framework of the netzentwurf.de, a relatively well-established Internet-based communication platform. This means that the studio was organised in the traditional structure consisting of an initial 3-day workshop, a face to face midterm review, and a collective final review, held 3.5 months later in the Museum of Communication in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. In teams of three (with each student from a different university and a tutor located at a fourth), the students worked over the Internet to produce collaborative design solutions. The groups ended up with designs that spanned a range of solutions between real and virtual architecture. Examples of the student's work (which is all available online) as well as their working methods are described. It must be said that the energy invested in the studio by the organisers of the virtual campus (as well as the students who took part) was considerably higher than in normal design studios and the paper seeks to look critically at the effort in relation to the outcomes achieved. The range and depth of the student's work was surprising to many in the project, especially considering the initial hurdles (both social and technological) that had to overcome. The self-referential nature of the theme, the method and the working environment encouraged the students to take a more philosophical approach to the design problem. The paper explores the implications of the student's conclusions on the nature of the university in general and draws conclusions specific to architectural education and the role of architecture in this process.

The respondents commented on the great value of ensemble participation and adopting teaching roles too. With widespread lore in society about the exceptional musical abilities of those with visual impairment, longstanding traditions of blind musicianship, plus evidence of distinct neural development and hearing, they acknowledged the cachet associated with blind musicians but, regardless, wished to be considered musicians first and foremost.

However, many of the new member states from the Eastern European countries which joined the European Union in 2004 have only weak forms of social dialogue.

Meaning making, a process in which people construct the meaning of events and experiences that are part of and shape our existence, represents an informal context of learning in that thinking and reflection is all that is required to accomplish this type of learning. Our meaning making equates to informal learning that develops through a lens in which we create the meaning of our experiences. Informal adult education, or casual opportunities to learn in adult life, is represented by the flexibility of the process, the experiential nature of the learning process, and the enthusiasm and dedication of the participants. Lifelong learning is an overarching experience that involves formal educational experiences. Lifelong learning is motivated internally, including the ability to establish favorable change in one's career trajectory As such, it can be argued that lifelong learners ascribe to a higher order of consciousness, specifically, self-authoring or self-transforming minds. The support, stimulation, and encouragement of lifelong learning, therefore, represents a construct for effective faculty development in graduate medical education.

Thus, international social, political and economic changes create a series of challenges towards open societies and increasing demand for a sustainable life long learning educational system. In this context lifelong learning becomes crucial in the development of a modern day citizen. Furthermore, the concept of education and transformation of knowledge through communicational activities has to be efficiently differentiated than normal academic standards. As presented in this paper communication in adult education is recognized as a complicated process that cannot only be channeled via verbal communication. According to a series of researches, non verbal communication emerges as a positive factor in creating a successful and sustainable communicational context, as it represents the 95% of total human to human interaction and semiotic communication. Hence non verbal communication is the most important element of general human communication. As a result non verbal communication affects drastically pedagogical climate in an educational activity and signifies the success of a life long education learning environment. An adult educator is obliged to successfully cope with and efficiently use techniques and goals that develop non-verbal educational communication. In this paper non verbal communication is presented as a basic axis in life long education through research and bibliography. As a basic educational tool, it should be developed as a power tool through conventional and interactive power tools. Successful communicational channels between educators and adult students create intrinsic educational activities and promote positive climate in class. Balanced semiotic communicative activities, both verbal and non-verbal can enhance educational awareness and social interactivity between all members of a given educational context. In this paper non verbal communication is presented as an irreplaceable factor in promoting a sustainable and successful educational context.",2012,,,6144,6149

The paper reports on details of the system, evaluation results, as well as future plans. It is argued that this system can support both short-term and long-term learning, and with the multi-dimensional link augmentation, it would provide a more dynamic STEM learning environment.

This paper argues that taking Chinese immigrant mothers' learning and mothering experience as a standpoint is critical to view transnational lifelong learning as non-linear, fluid, and dynamic. This perspective could assist scholars to acknowledge the experience, identity, work, and knowledge of immigrant mothers, to highlight the intersectionality of race, gender, and class, critically analyse the public/private binary and the learning space of lifelong learners, to reflect on the relationship between learning, mothering and transnational cultural capital, and to examine the race, gender and class relations underlying the changing meanings of lifelong learning in the context of transnational migration.",2020,18,4,406,419

Specifically, we analyse professional courses in Vale do Ave (North) and adult education and training courses in Alentejo Litoral (South). These regions were selected due to their dissimilar economic structure. This study adopted a qualitative approach through interviews with LLL experts and policy roundtables with local stakeholders and decision-makers in both regions. Data were transcribed and analysed using NVivo 10. The study shows that the two regions have different cooperation networks between local stakeholders, and that these impact the opportunities to influence the regional skills formation system differently. Also, the study shows that LLL policies are not designed to address destandardised life courses.",2020,39,1,61,74

Little is known about levels of confidence in, and educational needs concerning, clinical anatomy knowledge amongst foundation year doctors. Aims To establish foundation year doctors' perceptions of anatomy related to: importance to career, confidence in anatomy knowledge and its application, preferred methods of teaching. Secondarily, to determine impact of an integrated clinical approach to anatomy teaching on foundation year doctors' level of knowledge and confidence in its clinical application of anatomy. Methods A course teaching anatomy through common surgeries and related radiology was delivered to foundation year doctors. A pre- and post-course assessment based on anatomy competence score assessed holistic knowledge acquisition. Foundation year doctors' perceptions of anatomy and course satisfaction were measured through questionnaire. Results Confidence in applying anatomy knowledge was low. The average pre- and post-course assessment score increased from 55% to 81%; 92.86% felt an integrated clinical approach to anatomy teaching improved their confidence on the subject and 58.62% felt it improved their clinical skills.

At the same time, most municipalities are striving to recruit and keep competent health personnel. New ways of organising and increasing the competence of the workforce may help ensure that the healthcare delivered corresponds to patients' changing needs.Design and Methods: Nursing staff were encouraged to complete targeted competence enhancing activities with the aim of enhancing their competence in identified areas. The learning activities were blended and consisted of e-learning courses, lectures, supervision, vocational training and meetings with a superior. Competence was measured before and after the competence enhancing activities (n = 96). The STROBE checklist was applied.Results: The results provide insight into the competence development of registered nurses and assistant nurses in institutional community health services. They show that the implementation of a workplace-based blended learning programme improved competence significantly, especially for assistant nurses.Conclusions: Offering workplace-based competence enhancing activities seems to be a sustainable way of facilitating lifelong learning among nursing staff.

What is overlooked, however, is that the process of accumulation and actualisation is embedded within the culture of recognition. People who are historically constructed as the anthropos, a legacy of the colonial history struggle to appear as equals vis-a-vis the gaze of the humantias. With this critique in view, I reviewed the field of immigrant and lifelong learning in relation to a postcolonial politics of appearance. I sought to understand how lifelong learning settles itself in immigrant consciousness, and how it shapes immigrant experiences in the West. My review points to three metaphors that speak of the challenges and possibilities for immigrants to appear: fixation of the Eurocentric gaze, re-credentialing as precarious investment, and lifelong learning as trans/formation. Together, these metaphors suggest that lifelong learning has conjured a racial contract, which ironically binds immigrants to the labour of learning and yet continuously suppresses their appearance. To unsettle this racial contract, borders need to be reimagined and crossed/vexed by recentring immigrants as knowing subjects.",2019,38,1,34,47

It is a qualitative study that focuses on policy documents that form the European Union's legal and political frameworks of reference in the lifelong learning area since 1992. The document analysis has been complemented by semi-structured interviews with EU lifelong learning experts. The findings show that early school leavers and migrants are the main target groups in the policies, leaving many other groups at risk of being excluded from learning opportunities. There is not enough attention to measures addressing wider social phenomena. There is also an overemphasis on basic skills which are understood in a very narrow way as literacy and numeracy when referring to the vulnerable. We argue that a greater variety of measures as well as better targeted measures are needed to address the multiple and complex needs of the vulnerable. Such measures would allow a broader understanding of lifelong learning where those that are hardest to reach are offered learning opportunities independent of their personal and social circumstances",2020,39,1,5,17

It describes their varying patterns of participation in lifelong learning and their use of technology for learning and leisure. It finds that 37% of all adults report no further education of any kind after reaching compulsory school leaving age. This proportion declines with each age cohort, but is largely replaced by a pattern of lengthening initial education and still reporting no later education. These patterns of participation are predictable to a large extent from regression analysis using a life-order model of determining variables - all of which are set very early in life. This suggests that universal theories to describe participation, such as human capital theory, are incorrect in several respects. Where individuals create, for themselves and through their early experiences, a 'learner identity' inimicable to further study, then the prospect of learning can become a burden rather than an investment for them.

We must take into consideration current international, European and Italian data relating to poverty, both absolute and relative, which also include educational poverty, which make the achievement of goals aimed at equity even more complex and difficult. In this perspective, it is essential to reflect and remove obstacles to ensure full right to education for all, without discrimination, in a dimension of inclusive education. In a present disoriented and disintegrating society, there is increasingly strong need for recovering own identity and subjectivity, through appropriate pedagogical strategies guided by the concept of equity. In an international scenario, also characterized by a strong economic and financial crisis, and in a national context where the expenditure on education is steadily decreasing, it has been developed an autobiographical writing project in a bottom-up perspective, through an original format used in various contexts, school, university, workplace, including some difficult, such as prison or gender anti-violence centres. Autobiographical methods, therefore, allow reflecting about self, through experiences lived in past, and to build own identity, to help in integrating and relating actively and fruitfully in society. The research project fits in the now settled tradition of narrative pedagogy (i.e., Alberici, Alheit, Cambi, Demetrio, Dominice, Merrill, West) and it is a research/education project. An original autobiographical format and a final satisfaction questionnaire had administered. Data analysis had based on both quantitative and qualitative methodologies, the latter is a simplified protocol as result of an original reworking of Grounded Theory by Glaser and Strauss. Through retrospect, the individual is able to find a new way of life characterized by a strong educational and training impact, implying a cognitive and social change. Main results show that participants feel great need to reflect on themselves and to talk about themselves and communicate. From the various stories and from the lived experiences it emerges that the autobiographical methods represent an effective tool to recover the dimensions of personal identity but also of collective and social history. Writing about oneself, therefore, especially in difficult contexts or moments, allows recovering the dimensions of meaning of one's life. A broader reflection on oneself also reveals knowledge and deeper awareness of the skills and competences acquired and of which further educational courses to undertake in a lifelong, lifewide and lifedeep learning perspective. Moreover, the autobiographical methods prove to be of support to continue to plan one's future in a more profitable and open way for others.

While we know about the need for nurses' continuing professional development, less is known about how nurses experience and perceive continuing professional development. A metasynthesis of how nurses experience and view continuing professional development may provide a basis for planning future continuing professional development interventions more effectively and take advantage of examples from different contexts. The aim of this paper is to conduct such a metasynthesis, investigating the qualitative research on nurses' experiences of continuing professional development. Methods: A metasynthesis of the qualitative literature was conducted. A total of 25 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Results: We determined five overarching themes, Organisational culture shapes the conditions, Supportive environment as a prerequisite, Attitudes and motivation reflect nurse's professional values, Nurses' perceptions of barriers and Perceived impact on practice as a core value. This metasynthesis highlights that nurses value continuing professional development and believe that it is fundamental to professionalism and lifelong learning. Moreover CPD is identified as important in improving patient care standards. Conclusions: Based on the metasynthesis, we argue that access to continuing professional development could be made more attainable, realistic and relevant. Expediently, organizations should adequately fund and make continuing professional development accessible. In turn, nurses should continue to actively engage in continuing professional development to maintain high standards of nursing care through competent practice.

The lifelong learning of physicians is vital in maintaining up-to-date and qualified health care, but rural physicians in many developing countries lack adequate medical professional developments. There has also been no empirical research focused on the lifelong learning of rural physician populations. The purpose of this study was to investigate the primary levels of lifelong learning of the rural physicians and to analyze group differences. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study on 1197 rural physicians using the Jefferson Scale of Physician Lifelong Learning (JSPLL). Cronbach's a coefficient, exploratory factor analysis, independent sample t-test, and one-way ANOVA followed by Student-Newman-Keuls test were performed to analyze the data. Results: For Chinese rural physicians, the JSPLL was reliable (Cronbach's a coefficient = 0.872) and valid, with exploratory factor analysis fitting a 3-factor model and accounting for a total of 60.46 % of the variance. The mean lifelong learning score was 45.56. Rural physicians generally performed worse in the technical skills in seeking information domain.

One important sphere of focus is education; many policy makers across the globe view lifelong learning as an essential means to prepare society for an AI future and look to AI as a way to deliver learning opportunities to meet these needs. AI is a complex social, cultural, and material artifact that is understood and constructed by different stakeholders in varied ways, and these differences have significant social and educational implications that need to be explored. Through analysis of thirty-four in-depth interviews with stakeholders from academia, commerce, and policy, alongside document analysis, we draw on the social construction of technology (SCOT) to illuminate the diverse understandings, perceptions of, and practices around AI. We find three different technological frames emerging from the three social groups and argue that commercial sector practices wield most power. We propose that greater awareness of the differing technical frames, more interactions among a wider set of relevant social groups, and a stronger focus on the kinds of educational outcomes society seeks are needed in order to design AI for learning in ways that facilitate a democratic education for all.",2021,46,1,166,191

Therefore human resource managers have to find ways to maximize human capital since companies that view learning as a key priority will be successful in the future. We witness the shrinkage of jobs in the manufacture of material goods in comparison to professional and service occupations that involve working with knowledge or people. In new economies business success no longer relies on improving efficiency, but rather on human capabilities. However the workforce is aging in all developed countries and subsequent trend of workforce aging will continue for decades. In this context mature workers play dominant role in workforce because the supply of younger workers is becoming depleted. Companies that retain mature workers will achieve competitive advantages over those that will ignore demographic trends. In this context, continuous education and training of mature individuals is one of the most important agents of prolonging working life because up-to-date knowledge and skills are, above adequate health status, factors of work ability which by appropriate work settings set basis of high performance. According to human capital theory, lifelong learning increases human capital, therefore companies have to encourage all their workers to participate in training and development regardless of age because of the rapid changing working environment. Human resource departments provide learning opportunities that help employees to be ready for competition within a global economy since employees who acquire a wider range of skills become the organizations' valuable assets. Up-to-date knowledge and skills enable much quicker adaptation to internal and external business demands and at the same time productivity is preserved under any conditions. The purpose of the paper is to provide a discussion of integrative approach toward lifelong learning strategies as the key building strategy to retain mature workers. When drawing up the most important human resource practices in pursuance of retaining mature workers, knowledge workers' workability model with the focus on lifelong learning is being proposed.",2013,,,873,880

In the Education 4.0 framework, challenges of the fourth Industrial Revolution (IR4.0) are addressed about the Malaysia Education Blueprint for Higher Education 2015-2025. It is imperative that students are equipped with ICT and collaborative skills and be interested in lifelong learning. They also need to have critical and creative thinking and communicative skills. Statistics show that the number of unemployed graduates in Malaysia is worrying; there are many possible causes for this. One of the most common causes is that employer's look upon fresh graduates as liabilities who need to be provided with extra training before they can function adequately in their job. On this matter, have fresh graduates been equipped enough to face the industry? Are educators making themselves relevant by IR4.0? How can the Education 4.0 framework work for educators? Only time will reveal the true state of educators' readiness. Education in the 21st century is all about embracing digital technology. The Government's aspiration for our future generation is for them to be tech-savvy. This is living with the changing times. Shortly, according to a survey, some of the jobs today will no longer be relevant. New jobs will emerge and these will most likely be catering to the digital age.

To this purpose, a twofold procedure is adopted here: first, LLL incidence is estimated for the total number of men and women taken separately, regardless of their country of residence; second, the information on the country where they live is taken into account and 21 country-specific equations are computed. Again, this is made for both sexes. This procedure allows us to shed light on cross-country gender differences. In the whole sample, our results show that for both men and women formal LLL incidence is significantly higher among young, better-educated, part-time and temporary workers, and lower among those who changed their job in the preceding year, are employed in small firms and have low-skilled occupations. When the above-mentioned separate equations are estimated for each country and for both sexes, relevant results emerge in the case of Scandinavian countries.

Do they really know that life can become an actual learning environment? In general terms, what kind of learning can the third sectors offer to adults? KVALUES - Key competences: Validating Adult Learners' EdUcational ExperienceS is a EU funded project that aims to contribute to this debate by identifying what competences and skills can be evaluated. KVALUES is a two-year project that brings together adult cultural educators from Italy, UK, Germany, Sweden, Estonia, Bulgaria to develop and test the digital storytelling methodology as an innovative tool to guide adults and young adults in disadvantaged conditions to self-evaluate and recognize skills and key competences acquired through informal learning contexts. The idea of the project springs from the successful feedback received from the previous project DeTALES - Digital Education Through Adult Learners EU-Enlargement Stories, which showed that digital storytelling is a useful mean to engage people of all ages and backgrounds. Based on past experiences in adult education and in the cultural field, KVALUES partners realized that the target group in question (adults, young adults in disadvantaged conditions, unemployed, inactive people) is not aware that work or life experiences can be turned into learning opportunities. They aren't aware that, not only practical skills are useful to find a job or a better job position, but also the key competences such as social, transversal, cultural, creative and entrepreneurial thinking skills are an added value to their curricula. The implementation of a digital curricular story puts the individual at the center of the learning, fostering key competences (creative, entrepreneurial, basics, cultural, etc.) and, consequently, the need/willingness to undertake a new training process. The process of validation helps learners to think about what they have achieved so far and identify their strengths and skills. It helps to identify longer-term goals and what they need to do to achieve them. The use of digital tools, combined with the narrative process, aims to encourage individuals, usually excluded from traditional pathways of formal training and aiming at transferring practical skills, to become more aware of the importance of key competences to help them to re-enter the labour market.",2014,,,405,414

Quantitative data were collected using Lifelong Learning Scale (LLS) and Perceived Self-Regulation Scale (PSRS). Qualitative data of the study were collected by semi-structured interviews conducted with 15 students. The quantitative data of the study were analyzed by independent samples t test, ANOVA and Pearson Product-Moment Correlation analysis. In the analysis of the qualitative data, inductive content analysis was used.

When the opinions of the gifted students about lifelong learning tendencies are examined, it is seen that participants determine the reasons of the problems and go for solutions in line with their purpose, they like to produce solutions by making intellectual struggles, and they make scientific and non-scientific readings and use these readings to produce different solutions. It was also seen that they tried different ways to correct their mistakes.

Since the academic year 2011-2012, the introduction, for the first time, of EE / ESD in the curriculum of public primary schools in Cyprus, as part of a broader Education Reform, presented the combatant teachers with a fait accompli, which gave them additional responsibilities and duties. Despite the fact that this initiative was promoted by the government of the Republic of Cyprus, it is important to mention that most of the teachers never received any substantial and relevant training before the implementation of the new curricula, neither had received any education on these topics during their university studies. In this context, this paper proposes an in-situ training program for primary school teachers. This partially experiential program is consistent with the principles of adult education, since it takes into consideration the potential ability of the teachers to reflect critically and their tendency to self-determination and active participation in the learning process. The program has been evaluated according to the Stufflebeam evaluation model (CIPP), one of the most popular and recognized models for the evaluation of educational programs.

Then, we proceed to the input evaluation, with emphasis on setting timelines, strategies and procedures for the implementation of the program, with reference to both literature and practice. The phase of the process evaluation has mainly a formative nature and assesses the actions and activities in a joint discussion of all involved people.

Lifelong learning is a common strategy to cope with this, and is particularly important in professional disciplines for fulfilment of required continuing professional development (CPD) set by the related professional bodies. The possibility of a portfolio approach to lifelong learning is explored in this chapter. Issues of a portfolio including its definition, types, pedagogy, theoretical base and implementation methods are discussed. Relationships between portfolios and lifelong learning are then drawn. Adapting a portfolio to the lifelong learning context involves setting goals and plans, undertaking learning activities, capturing evidence of experiences in these activities, and reflecting on them. The outcomes of the reflection process will then inform further goal setting and planning, and hence forms a cyclic process to keep lifelong learning progressing. The portfolio becomes a track record of an individual's personal development over time and is an extremely useful support for activities such as job applications, appraisals, CPD and recognition of prior learning (RPL). Also, it helps individuals to better manage lifelong learning in their own way because the range of learning activities undertaken can be very broad and flexible, for example, new duty tryout in the workplace or taking a formal educational program. The process is self-regulatory in the manner in which it is conducted. Together with its other attractions such as a means for recognition of lifelong learning activities, negligible cost, promotion of reflective learning and practice, mapping of career pathways and development of personal and professional attributes and higher order skills, the portfolio outweighs other lifelong learning channels such as informal learning activities and formal courses.",2010,,,347,360

Professionals maintain their competency and survive in the labor market by learning new skills and creating knowledge, throughout their careers. In that respect, university teaching is claimed to have a special task to support students in adopting ways of thinking and producing new knowledge anchored in scientific inquiry practices. Yet, it is argued that students' habits of learning are still overwhelmingly skewed toward passive acquisition of knowledge from authority sources rather than from collaborative inquiry activities. This form of instruction is criticized for encouraging students to acquire inert knowledge that can be used in instructional settings at best, however cannot be transferred into real-life complex problem settings. In order to overcome this critical inadequacy between current educational goals and instructional methods, the LLAF consortium (including 16 members from 8 countries) is aimed at developing updated instructional practices that put a premium on adaptability to the emerging requirements of present society. LLAF has created a practical guide for teachers containing updated pedagogical strategies and assessment tools, based on the constructivist approach for learning that put a premium on adaptability to the emerging requirements of present society. This presentation will be limited to teachers' education only and to the contribution of a scale designed to measure the extent to which the problem-based learning activities are efficiently applied in the learning environment. This scale was integrated into the practical guide for teachers. A mix-method approach was implemented in two phases to construct the scale: The first phase included a qualitative content analysis involving both deductive and inductive category applications of students' observations. The results foregrounded eight categories: knowledge construction, authenticity, multiple perspectives, prior knowledge, in-depth learning, teacher-student interaction, social interaction and cooperative dialogue. The students' descriptions of their classes were formulated as 36 items. The second phase employed structural equation modeling (SEM). The scale was submitted to 597 undergraduate students. The goodness of fit of the data to the structural model yielded sufficient fit results. This research elaborates the body of literature by adding a category of in-depth learning which emerged from the content analysis. Moreover, the theoretical category of social activity has been extended to include two distinctive factors: cooperative dialogue and social interaction. Implications of these findings for the LLAF project are discussed.",2015,,,4762,4768

The professional progress is encouraged through lifelong education and training. In this context, online non-formal education is a very convenient and affordable method for a large share of the population. This form of education presents a series of advantages that make it particularly suitable for those that are already engaged in the work field and wish to further develop their careers. Organic agriculture is a field of activity registering an increase in popularity both in numbers of consumers and in the numbers of those involved in the production and selling of respective products. To this purpose, organic agriculture is very well suited as an area of expertise in which online software can be successfully used to acquire up to date information and knowledge.

In looking for the intersections between these concepts to connote them with a more humanistic and holistic perspective, we explore the potentials of distance learning in the lives of adult learners. The empirical basis for this exploration is a survey applied to 706 (143 respondents) graduates in the education of the Portuguese Open University to know their future projects and the impact of this degree in the various dimensions of their personal, social and professional lives. The conclusions of this analysis point to recognition, by the respondents, of the positive impacts that distance higher education has in their personal and social lives. However, these impacts are not as visible in professional terms since the answers show little significant professional progressions. In this sense, the article concludes that it is important to rethink the founding ideas of the concept of lifelong learning from a humanistic perspective and to approach it with a holistic and transversal conception of what is now defined as digital literacy. Distance education, for adult learners, is a scenario that not only strengthens the personal, social and professional development of individuals, but also the development of competencies applied not only to the digital world but also to each person's daily activities.",2020,12,4,439,456

It was designed to provide both traditional-age and mature students with opportunities to earn academic qualifications, including Bachelor's degrees, at low cost and in collaboration with the traditional system. In a literature review, the authors analyse the system with reference to the underlying ideology (i.e., credentialism, an emphasis on formal credentials) and hegemonic (dominant) characteristics (i.e., the foci of formal education and the educational norms created by the government-centred administrative system) in which ACBS operates, particularly in the context of lifelong learning. The authors investigate why an ACBS degree is still not considered to be equivalent to a traditional degree in the job market. Their data are drawn from the domestic and international literature relating to ACBS, including policy reports which tend to offer only descriptions of ACBS without subjecting the educational system itself to even small-scale analysis. The authors found that ACBS is limited primarily with regard to social recognition and that this systemic limitation is an outcome of Korea's academic credentialism. In particular, they argue that a non-formal learning domain cannot be successful unless the credentials it produces are perceived as comparable to those from the dominant (i.e., traditional) system of higher education. Overall, this study advances the education field's understanding of ACBS by using a critical lens to unveil tensions in practice and identify problems at the ground level, which cannot be identified merely through statistical evaluation. The authors conclude this article with a suggestion of in-depth, qualitative examinations and critical reflection on ACBS.",2019,65,6,975,990

Findings - The results revealed that these journalists perceived themselves as information literate. The information literacy (IL) skills of journalists appeared to have a direct and positive effect on their lifelong learning, creativity, and work performance. In other words, the lifelong learning, creativity, and work performance of journalists increase as their levels of IL skills increase. Practical implications - These results generated useful insights for academicians and organizations about the importance of IL in the workplace and its influence on organizational effectiveness and performance in gaining a sustainable competitive advantage. This knowledge might be crucial for media employers to initiate training programs for journalists to impart IL education.

Among the students registered in computer science, only 31% (the minimum within STEM) stayed to the end to get their degree. In another angle, recent surveys found that graduates in computer science are lacking in many areas, including technical abilities, personal skills, and professional qualities. The widespread complaint from many industries, if not all, is that we are not graduating students with the skills they need for their careers. These two observations raise serious concerns about (or at least challenge us to rethink) the way computer science is taught in our universities. The contribution of this paper is a step in the direction of addressing the concerns described above. We advocate a radical change in the computer science education; it must gradually reduce lecturedominated passive learning and replace it with suitable active learning techniques.

The purpose of this paper is to reflect some of the most important characteristics of the lifelong learning and adult training process in Europe and Romania, starting from the necessity of developing such a concept. Lifelong learning was the response or even the defense against a changing, frightening and unknown technological, economic, social and political environment; it became a concept as slippery and multifaceted as the environment in which it exists. The literature is very rich in this field; studies developed by different institutions (The Council of Europe, UNESCO, and OECD) or by specialists (Sutton, 1996; Maehl, 2000; Field 2000; Keogh, 2007) emphasize the importance of the concept and of the concept implementation's in sound policies designated to solve some of the technological, social and economic development consequences. The methodological approach followed in this paper is specific to descriptive studies, secondary data being the main source of the argumentation developed and of the conclusions drawn at the end. The analysis that sustains the present paper concludes to the necessity of integrating the concepts features in the policies established at the level of education, labor market and public administration. However, differences existed between countries and between regions, at the level of the EU and Romania require a decentralized approach, and a focusing on developing not only instruments of intervention but also on creating an evaluation framework meant to analyse the efficiency and effectiveness of the implemented programs.",2009,,,64,69

J,"Gopee, N",,,"Gopee, N",,Human and social capital as facilitators of lifelong learning in nursing,NURSE EDUCATION TODAY,,"To ensure that lifelong learning is, and remains, a reality as a vehicle for facilitating continuing professional learning in nursing, certain mechanisms need to be instituted specifically for this purpose. Some of the key organisational facilitators for achieving this include individual performance reviews, Workforce Development Confederations, professional self-regulation, and Investors in People awards. In a study exploring nurses' perceptions of lifelong learning, it emerged that in addition to the organisational mechanisms that are necessary to achieve this aspiration, there are also various non-organisational or informal factors at work that enable nurses to initiate and continue professional learning. it seems that substantial informal teaching, learning and facilitation of learning occur through work-based contacts with other healthcare professionals, and this is complemented by support from non-healthcare related other significant individuals. These factors seem to constitute the notion of human and social capital (HSC), which is a concept that has been implicated as a significant instigator or enabler of professional learning. This paper examines these non-organisational factors, clarifies the meanings and roles of human capital and social capital in healthcare, and discusses their implications for lifelong learning in nursing. The analysis is supported by findings from a qualitative study, which comprised of 27 semi-structured individual interviews and two focus groups with RNs on D grade and above.

To function in such an economy, engineers require a set of core professional skills in addition to technological know-how. Primary among these skills is recognition of the need for, and ability to engage in, life-long learning. Life-long learning, as defined by ABET is a broad, generic concept that is not only difficult to define and teach, but also challenging to assess. Often, faculty simply think of a lifelong learner as a student who asks excellent questions in class, who reads the textbook because he/she wants to learn for the sake of learning. Others indicate a belief that it is the curious student who does more than what is required on an assignment and goes that extra mile to please the instructor. In either case, the concept is oversimplified. This paper presents work on defining, teaching and assessing lifelong learning as part ABET readiness program at the Petroleum Institute (PI) in Abu Dhabi, UAE. We will focus on the process used to develop attributes/skills of a life-long learner in an engineering education program.

In the network economy Higher Education Institutions (HE Is) form a hub in research and development for societal innovation and transformation. Vulnerable groups in society can benefit from this, when future engineers give them and their unmet needs special attention.

Increasing effectiveness of education by providing authentic and activating learning environments are parts of the formula the CSE project focuses on. A combination of push and pull mechanisms can be set up in two ways between the technological enterprises, the social domain and HE Is. In these networks education can shift from teaching students to reinvent the wheel time and again in an artificial setting to letting them participate in interdisciplinary co-creation in an authentic learning environment, solving real problems in transformation research. HE Is can facilitate and monitor the learning processes of students and teaching staff.

The concept of lifelong learning, posited by Dewey in 1916, has been widely recognised since the 1970s. However, this concept is contested and there are many perspectives which may be in tension or even contradiction according to the lens adopted. The chapter will review some of these perspectives because the dominant one will affect the educational strategies and outcomes. The concept of adult numeracy - which arose in Britain in the 1950s - is becoming increasingly common and is also contested, as is the terminology (e.g., quantitative literacy). Drawing on the work of Bernstein, I will distinguish between mathematics and numeracy as the choice made can also have educational implications, although I have elsewhere argued for a convergence. For mathematics in particular, the concept of transfer is a vexed issue. It is commonly assumed that what is learned in the formal classroom or other learning site will automatically be recognised and applied unproblematically in the very different situation of the workplace. Curriculum and pedagogy for adult numeracy and vocational mathematics need to take cognisance of this and other important issues to avoid the situation of merely replicating the kinds of 'school' mathematics that many people, young and old, have been failed by and continue to avoid engaging with. In today's world, technology is playing an increasingly important role in educational situations, in the workplace, and at home. Technology plays a dual role in the teaching and learning of mathematics/numeracy for adults. Technology, electronic and othenvise, offers a medium to enhance learning in the form of tools such as rulers and compasses as well as software programs. Technology in the form of calculators of various kinds or computer applications, such as spreadsheets or statistics programs can act as aids to overcome the limitations of human memory or to support the exploration of new ideas by experimentation or simulation. However, these need to be made objects of learning in their own right before they can support higher level thinking. Electronic technologies offer increasingly sophisticated means of communication, in education and at work or society at large.",2010,,,1,35

There are several implications for the further development of the lifelong guidance system: development of a system of accessible career guidance that goes beyond psychological assessment and takes into account identity-related issues, showing the connection between learning and career development, development of alternative pathways to qualification (recognition of prior learning) and supporting the development of career management skills.",2016,44,2,198,209

Now that radiologists are participating in the maintenance of certification process, there is an increased need for self-assessment modules that include MCQs and persons with test item-writing skills to develop such modules. Although principles of effective test item writing have been documented, violations of these principles are common in medical education. Guidelines for test construction are related to development of educational objectives, defining levels of learning for each objective, and writing effective MCQs that test that learning. Educational objectives should be written in observable, behavioral terms that allow for an accurate assessment of whether the learner has achieved the objectives. Learning occurs at many levels, from simple recall to problem solving. The educational objectives and the MCQs that accompany them should target all levels of learning appropriate for the given content. Characteristics of effective MCQs can be described in terms of the overall item, the stem, and the options. Flawed MCQs interfere with accurate and meaningful interpretation of test scores and negatively affect student pass rates. Therefore, to develop reliable and valid tests, items must be constructed that are free of such flaws.

This goal (SDG4) is subdivided into 10 targets, the sixth of which concerns youth and adult literacy and numeracy. This article examines the current discursive landscape around SDG target 4.6, to determine the extent to which it reflects the lifelong learning perspective guiding the Education 2030 Framework for Action. SDG target 4.6 envisages a minimum proficiency level in literacy and numeracy which is equivalent to the level achieved upon successful completion of basic education. The author's analysis unpacks lifelong literacy, and discerns three closely interrelated dimensions, namely (1) literacy as a lifelong learning process; (2) literacy as a life-wide process; and (3) literacy as part of sector-wide reforms towards lifelong learning systems. Although available documentary evidence is still limited, the author identifies a number of broad trends, many of which do not give cause for optimism. She argues that an expanded vision of literacy has not yet taken hold. There is still a long way to go before literacy (and numeracy) are tackled from a lifelong learning perspective, which would potentially have a transformative effect on the achievement of the SDGs.",2019,65,2,251,275

However, what is less certain in remedial education literature is how faculty members play a critical role in motivating the tendencies for LLL among remediated science students, especially in the developing countries. Therefore, this study investigated the contributions of faculty caring and student engagement to remediated science students' perceived LLL tendencies. Correlational research design was used to measure and gauge the level of the relationships amongst the studying variables. A total of 443 continuing education programme students in Nigeria participated in the study. By using AMOS v. 24 and SPSS v. 26 statistical tools for data analyses, we found a high level of student-perceived faculty caring, student engagement components and LLL tendencies. Multilevel regression analyses indicated that the dimensions of students' LLL tendencies (motivation and perseverance) were positively predicted by faculty caring and student engagement dimensions, such as vigour, absorption and dedication. In the final models, the predictor variables could explain some substantive proportions of motivation and perseverance dimensions of LLL tendencies. Our study findings reveal that faculty caring plays a significant role in motivating students' academic engagement and the tendencies for LLL in higher education. Therefore, educational intervention that gears towards improving student academic engagement has a practical implication in enhancing LLL tendencies amongst higher education science students. Hence, the study findings could inspire various educational practitioners to encourage effective academic engagement amongst higher education science students.

There is, therefore, an increased emphasis on the personal dimension of lifelong learning and on the need to reflexively engage in the (re)construction of one's self and identity. We can find this, for example, in Anthony Giddens's idea of the reflexive project of the self. The authors argue that this idea is too individualistic and lacks recognition of the moral dimension of self-formation. It therefore not only leads to an impoverished conception of the self but also to an impoverished view of the role of learning in this process. The authors present ideas from Charles Taylor on self and identity to show the role that moral and intersubjective dimensions play in the formation of self and identity. The authors argue that Taylor's work points to a different form of lifelong learning in late-modernity, one that is more explicitly concerned with the moral dimension of lifelong learning and adult education.",2012,62,4,332,350

Lifelong learning, however, has not been fully integrated into this discourse. Using survey data provided by 416 adults (aged 60 years and above) enrolled in non-formal general-interest courses in a public continuing education programme in Canada, this study examined the association between older adults' duration of participation in the courses and their level of psychological wellbeing, while taking their age, gender, self-rated health and vulnerability level into consideration. An analytical framework was developed based on the literature of old-age vulnerabilities and the benefits of lifelong learning. Two logistic regression and trend analyses were conducted. The results indicate that older adults' participation is independently and positively associated with their psychological wellbeing, even among those typically classified as vulnerable'. This result provides additional evidence that suggests the continuous participation in non-formal lifelong learning may help sustain older adults' psychological wellbeing. It provides older learners, even those who are most vulnerable, with a compensatory strategy to strengthen their reserve capacities, allowing them to be autonomous and fulfilled in their everyday life. The result of this study highlights the value of the strategic and unequivocal promotion of community-based non-formal lifelong learning opportunities for developing inclusive, equitable and caring active ageing societies.",2018,38,4,651,675

The paper discusses the preparation for employment of undergraduates by the integration of external vocational qualifications into academic courses, and using these in preparation for life-long learning. Many of the assessments discussed are via on-line learning, making these independent of global location for those that use computers in a work environment or at home, possibly via mobile technology. For degree courses, ICDL (International Computer Driving Licence) could be taken by all first year undergraduates. For network related degree vocational qualifications, such as the Ethical Hacker, the whole course can be purchased; this is similarly the case for Cisco qualifications. Undergraduate degree and Masters Students can take a range of vocational qualifications that can be assessed on-line, such as those for Microsoft and ISEB qualifications. In certain disciplines, such as for accounting, this approach of designing courses that relate to professional qualifications is a usual practice. The current benefits are examined and discussed including increased employability, as additional professional qualifications, globally recognised, can be achieved in addition to academic qualifications. The future benefits are also considered, such as raising awareness of external qualifications of examination bodies for post academic assessment of skills, to coincide with current employment; the availability worldwide, and online learning which is suitable for self-study, using mainly free material online, in preparation for online assessments, which are particularly useful during career breaks (such as on maternity leave, illness, gaps between jobs following redundancy etc). The authors conclude that in this era of globalisation e-learning has facilitated and continues to play an important role in the process of integration of university and professional qualifications useful for employability and sustainable lifelong learning in diverse fields of specialisation.",2013,,,404,408

Findings The academic literature discusses more than 280 skills and competences related to the job profile of logistics and supply chain managers. The majority of these skills represent social skills. Analyses of job postings show significant differences in the required portfolio of skills and competences depending on the hierarchical level of the position. Contrary to the literature, job postings include more cognitive competences and meta-competences than social skills. Originality/value The first contribution of this research is that competences were examined from the perspective of lifelong learning, revealing how this is applied in the field of logistics. The second is that this conceptual framework can be utilised to compare skills and competences between different hierarchical levels. The third contribution refers to identifying a set of skills and competences different to what had been presented in the literature.",2018,23,1,50,64

This critical policy analysis uses Marx's theory of labour-power, as conceptualised by Glenn Rikowski, to examine the Skills and Post-16 Education Act, 2022 and to identify its ideological roots, its distribution of power, resources and knowledge, and the potential effect it will have on inequality. Findings indicate that while the Act aims to make it easier for adults to study more flexibly, not all adults will have the labour-power attributes and financial resources to access the higher-level qualifications prioritised for funding. This article argues that the Act represents a general deepening of neoliberalism in lifelong learning that will further stratify adult education and increase inequalities.

Standard literature on human capital generally considers the level of investment in education and training as an economic measure for employers and for the economy as a whole (Schultz 1960). Social capital refers to human and social resources that people derive from their reciprocal relation (Putnam 2000; Field 2010). Lifelong learning origins in policy domain rather than in the social science context; in the last 2 decades, this concept has gained momentum in the European political agenda, becoming the core concept of the educational and training policy of the last generation. The paper contributes, with an interdisciplinary approach, to define more precisely the meaning of lifelong learning practices and their contribution to building a more efficient educational and social system where both positive economic impacts and social effects are observable (Lave & Wenger, 1991; Wertsch 1991; Engestrom, 1995 and 2009). Drawing on a review of literature, the aim of this paper is to outline a logical framework for human and social capital infrastructures (Treelle, 2010), which stresses the importance of lifelong, lifewide and lifedeep learning. On this ground, the resulting logical framework will be outlined as follows. First, we debate the development of educational opportunities in formal and non-formal contexts for a more balanced and efficient educational-training system; then we will focus on the importance of building solidarity networks, which reinforce subjective wellbeing, health, safety perception; finally, we will highlight the need for compensating the negative effects of socio-economic conditions of marginalization and social exclusion.",2015,,,7264,7269

Drawing on the theoretical scheme, another aim was to design and validate a questionnaire to measure students' perceptions of their reflective writing experiences. The last aim was to quantitatively measure the link between perceived reflective writing and students' tendency to use RJs in their future careers and personal lives. This exploratory sequential research included the following steps: First, experts' review and analysis of 1312 RJ entries were attained. This step led to the design of a theoretical scheme of reflective writing and a 31-item questionnaire, used to gather data from 171 students (second-year pre-service teachers and third-year health managers). Partial Least Squares analysis corroborated the structure suggested by the theoretical scheme: two timelines-reflections regarding the current course assignments and those related to the student's future development. Students' tendency to use reflective skills in their future professional lives was highly connected to their long-term reflections, including learning experiences linked to academic, professional, personal, and multicultural development. The current study's suggested validated generic scheme can be adapted and integrated into different curricula, thereby possibly increasing the potential of infusing RJ instructional strategies into higher education curricula, improving the quality of reflection in student journals, and promoting lifelong learning skills.",2022,12,,,

Higher Education (HE) institutions should be committed to developing lifelong learning, that is promoting learning that is flexible, diverse and relevant at different times, and in different places, and is pursued throughout life. Therefore the HE sector needs to develop effective strategies to encourage engagement in meaningful learning for diverse student populations. The use of e-portfolios, as a 'purposeful aggregation of digital items' (Sutherland & Powell, 2007), can meet the needs of the student community by encouraging reflection, the recording of experiences and achievements, and personal development planning (PDP). The use of e-portfolios also promotes inclusivity in learning as it provides students with the opportunity to articulate their aspirations and take the first steps along the pathway of lifelong learning. However, ensuring the uptake of opportunities within their learning is more complex than the students simply having access to the software. Therefore it is argued here that crucial to the effective uptake and engagement of the e-portfolio is embedding it purposefully within the curriculum. In order to investigate effective implementation of e-portfolios an explanatory case study on their use was carried out, initially focusing on 3 groups of students engaged in work-based learning and professional practice. The 3 groups had e-Portfolios embedded and assessed at different levels. Group 1 did not have the e-Portfolio embedded into their curriculum nor was the e-Portfolio assessed. Group 2 had the e-Portfolio embedded into the curriculum and formatively assessed. Group 3 also had the e-Portfolio embedded into the curriculum and were summatively assessed. Results suggest that the use of e-Portfolios needs to be integral to curriculum design in modules rather than used as an additional tool. In addition to this more user engagement was found in group 2 where the e-Portfolio was formatively assessed only. The implications of this case study are further discussed in terms of curriculum development.",2009,,,687,694

The nature of lifelong learning focuses on what is possible in the future as opposed to what has happened in the past. A lack of analysis of the teaching process from the student's perspective may widen the distance between the teaching process and learning. It may also prevent us from understanding how teaching relates to the development of lifelong learning and, as a result, a sustainable future. A qualitative, phenomenological method was employed to provide insight into the dynamics of what students learn and how they, as subjects, experience a teaching process that supports their lifelong learning development. Three themes concerning what teachers do emerged from the analysis of interviewees' descriptions: teachers are self-based, teachers are embodying the work, and teachers are promoting affective engagement. Our results suggest that in becoming lifelong learners students wish to find meaning and live their lives authentically as participants and not as spectators. The results of our study have implications for higher education and its pedagogical practice for cultivating lifelong learners with a continuous commitment to constructing self-based, authentic futures.

Seeking to ensure accessibility of education to everybody, equal conditions are introduced: technologization of the learning process through virtual learning environments leads to assurance of the level of convenient use, which diverts the attention from the essence, i.e. from the creation of elite culture in personality education.

J,"Ollis, T",,,"Ollis, Tracey",,Learning in social action: The informal and social learning dimensions of circumstantial and lifelong activists,AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ADULT LEARNING,,"This paper explores the informal and social learning dimensions of activists as they learn skills and knowledge through participating in social action. In doing this I draw on Lave and Wenger's epistemology of situated learning and Bourdieu's theory of 'habitus'. I argue activists learn an array of community development skills in the social environment of activism. I claim activists' learning is cognitive, embodied and situated in practice. This paper is based on empirical research in Australia, where in-depth interviews were conducted with activists to uncover their important pedagogy. It explores the learning dimensions of two groups of activists. 'Lifelong activists' who have generally been involved in student politics and have participated in activism over many years, and 'circumstantial activists' who become involved in protest due to a series of life circumstances. This paper claims that while both groups' learning is social and informal, lifelong activists tend to develop their skills incrementally by being involved in the fertile site of student politics. On the other hand, circumstantial activists, not having had the benefit of early immersion in a community of practice, are rapid learners. They are frequently taken out of their comfort zone as activists and need to acquire new knowledge and skills urgently in order to practise effectively. Some circumstantial activists remain on the periphery of activism and never fully immerse themselves in the practices of activism. I argue there is much to be gained from understanding learning in social action, an epistemology of adult learning which deserves greater prominence in current adult education discourse.",2011,51,2,248,268

Less attention has been paid to the lifelong learner. We conceptualized a tripartite relationship between three measures of learning preference: conceptions of knowledge (construction and use vs. intake), need for cognition (high vs. low), and approach to study (deep vs. surface) and hypothesized that an individual's profile on these three measures-reconceptualized as a preference for complexity versus simplicity would affect their attitude toward continuing professional development (CPD). A questionnaire was mailed to 2,000 randomly selected, home-practicing UK veterinarians to quantify their learning preferences, motivation to engage in CPD, and perception of barriers to participation and to assess the relationships between these constructs. Analysis of 775 responses (a 38.8% response rate) confirmed our tripartite model of learning and showed that a preference for complexity was negatively correlated with barriers and positively correlated with intrinsic, social, and extrinsic motivating factors, suggesting that all play a role in the continuing education of this group of professionals. A preference for simplicity was negatively correlated with social motivation and positively correlated with barriers. This study demonstrates that approach not only affects the quality of learning but crucially affects motivation to engage in CPD and perception of barriers to lifelong learning. This should emphasize to veterinary educators the importance of fostering a preference for complexity from an early age, both in terms of its immediate benefits (better understanding) and longer-term benefits (continued engagement with learning).",2010,37,2,165,171

A further aim was to monitor the effect of the training intervention, and individuals' views and attitudes towards e-portfolio usage in their continuous professional development. Materials and Methods: Questionnaires were initially distributed to 142 radiology professionals in the pre-intervention phase to investigate individuals' knowledge and understanding of e-portfolios. An intervention phase was then carried out consisting of training such as lectures, handouts, and group discussions relative to the benefits of e-portfolio use. Post-intervention questionnaires were then distributed to those participants who had responded to the initial survey and had experienced training during the intervention phase. Quantitative data were collected through the pre and post-intervention questionnaires using attitudinal questions with Likert scales. Results were then analyzed to determine any significant correlations following the intervention. Results: Ninety-nine respondents completed the questionnaire in the pre-intervention phase resulting in a response rate of 70%. The response rate decreased to 55% in the post-intervention phase. Statistically, significant post-intervention results indicate that radiology professionals' perceptions towards e-portfolios improved following training and enhanced their interest to adopt it for lifelong learning. Discussion: It is evident that individuals' understanding of what e-portfolios are and how they can help to develop an individual both professionally and personally is lacking. Following the intervention period the positive responses from participants increased significantly indicating that in order to encourage the future use of e-portfolios amongst those who work in radiology, either clinically or academically, prior training and awareness sessions would be beneficial.",2017,13,4,495,501

The current study examines whether and how psychosocial beliefs about lifelong learning differ between adults with different levels of educational attainment. The Theory of Planned Behaviour, which focuses on three specific psychosocial beliefs (related to Perceived Behavioural Control, Perceived Social Norms, and Attitudes) is used as a theoretical framework. In total, 563 adults completed our survey. ANOVA-analyses were used to study between-groups differences. The results demonstrated that low- and medium-educated adults' experiences with psychosocial barriers are quite similar, except for power of control, since medium-educated adults experience more control over learning skills needed to participate. High-educated adults experience statistically significant more social pressure to engage in lifelong learning, especially from their work-related referents. In addition, high-educated adults experience statistically significant more control over their participation, specifically when it comes to control over skills necessary to participate in learning. Low-and medium-educated adults do show positive attitudes towards learning, but high-educated adults' attitudes are statistically significant more positive. Follow-up, qualitative studies could provide in-depth insight into these determinants.

In the Portuguese settings, in which the re-certification of physicians' skills or knowledge is currently not required, the exercise of LLL is left to personal motivation and initiative. The importance of LLL has been highlighted in numerous international recommendations and has already led, in the United States, to the development and validation of a scale for measuring physician LLL - the Jefferson Scale of Physician Life Long Learning (JSPLL). The lack of valid instruments to measure LLL adapted to the Portuguese contexts was the basis for this work, which presents the translation and adaptation of JSPLL, and the subsequent validation of the translated version to the Portuguese medical community. The translation and validation of the English version of JSPLL (JSPLL-VP) was conducted with physicians of Health Care institutions in the District of Braga, Portugal, in 2007. Methods of both qualitative (translation, assessment of the translation, retro translation) and quantitative nature (internal consistency analysis, factor analysis and analysis of response frequencies) resulted in a factor analysis that replicated, with the exception of three items, the distribution of the original scale by four factors: professional learning beliefs and motivation, scholarly activities, attention to learning opportunities and technical skills in seeking information. The results show that the JSPLL-VP is a valid Scale fit for purpose. Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the whole scale (.89) and for each factor, confirmed the internal consistency of the Scale. Additionally, differences were found between mean and standard deviations for different Scale factors. In summary, this work provides a new validated tool to monitor physician's LLL in Portugal. The transversal characterization of LLL of specific medical professionals - by specialty or by type of institution - or longitudinal studies in relation with profiles of medical training can contribute to the quality of Medical Education at the pre- or post-graduate levels.",2009,22,3,247,256

In this first statistical study of graduating student performance, 10 years of student data have been analyzed. Data for more than 1100 graduated students were evaluated in the core mathematics and engineering science courses. There are no gender-based or visa/residency status-based differences in the cGPA (cumulative GPA) at graduation. Further, there is no gender-based difference in the performance in the mathematics and engineering science courses. However, students on study visas outperform their Domestic and Permanent Resident peers regardless of gender, and the difference persists into the upper years even though the concepts involved have been taught in our program. Students' life-long learning attribute has been investigated through analysis of completions of engineering minors and certificates. Nearly 60% of students graduate with at least one minor, and female students are 10% more likely to complete a minor than their male peers. Domestic female students are much more likely to complete minors in bioengineering or environmental engineering, whereas their male peers and study visa students are more likely to complete minors in sustainable energy.

In this paper, an attempt is made to combine two conceptual discussions-Life Course and Governance-bringing them to bear on the examination of how Lifelong Learning (LLL) policies have been used to govern young people's life courses. The paper synthesizes different discussions of the complex relations among governance, discourses and structures of opportunity that impact the governing of the life course and particularly educational trajectories. It suggests that the combination of life course research and a governance perspective enables analyzing the governance of educational trajectories along discursive, institutional and relational dimensions of opportunity structures. Considering these various dimensions, the paper argues, allows us to attend to the social interactions, decision-making processes and processing mechanisms that precede and/or underlie educational processes and thus favor or complicate them.

Therefore, continuing education (CE) and continuing professional development (CPD) are needed to secure safe and good quality healthcare. The aim of the study was to investigate the hypothesized associations and their directions between pharmacists' basic psychological needs in CE, their academic motivation, well-being, learning outcomes. Self-determination theory was used as a theoretical framework for this study. Data were collected through four questionnaires measuring: academic motivation, basic psychological needs (BPN), vitality and lifelong learning adaptability of pharmacists in the CE/CPD learning context. Structural equation modelling was used to analyze the data. Demographic factors like gender and working environment influenced the observed scores for frustration of BPN and factors like training status and working experience influenced the observed scores for academic motivation. A good model fit could be found only for a part of the hypothesized pathway. Frustration of BPN is positively directly related to the less desirable type of academic motivation, controlled motivation (0.88) and negatively directly related to vitality (- 1.61) and negatively indirectly related to learning outcomes in CE. Fulfillment or frustration of BPN are important predictors for well-being and learning outcomes. Further research should be conducted to discover how we can prevent these needs from being frustrated in order to design a motivating, vitalizing and sustainable CE/CPD system for pharmacists and other healthcare professionals. Basic psychological needs are very important predictors for well-being and learning outcomes.

However, once the 'conveyor belt effect'. of passing increasingly qualified 16-18 year-olds into the working-age population instead of less qualified 60 and 65 year-olds, is taken into account, then progress in qualifying those of working-age is much less. In fact, there is then very limited evidence that Lifelong Learning targets have had any impact at all. Certainly, work-based training has not increased, and may even have declined over the last decade, while some socio-economic inequalities in adult participation in education and training have worsened. The paper examines this apparent weakness for the current approach and its implications for the measurement of progress, in the light of a research review carried out for the National Assembly of Wales.

J,"McAvinia, C; Oliver, M",,,"McAvinia, C; Oliver, M",,But my subject's different: a web-based approach to supporting disciplinary lifelong learning skills,COMPUTERS & EDUCATION,,"Many new initiatives in Higher Education institutions choose to develop web sites to support their work, not least because web-based delivery of support materials from a central unit can help to deliver development materials via a single point of access, and 'on demand'. But this presents its own difficulties in terms of the selection and structure of generic material, and in making students aware of its existence. In this paper., the problem of designing a centrally managed web site (both in terms of structure and format) that adequately supports students across the institution will be discussed, and a strategy for developing a site that meets departmental needs will be presented, together with a discussion of the impact of this approach on the role of the developer. This is illustrated within the context of supporting Key Skills. 'Key' or 'transferable' skills are now recognised as being essential for most people in work and in life. Development of these skills is being encouraged at every level in education, and is demanded with increasing frequency by employers and professional bodies. Within Higher Education, the skills debate has prompted an examination of how students manage their own learning, and skills development initiatives encourage learners to seek ways of filling gaps in their knowledge and experience. However, at university level, it is frequently the case that explicit development of key skills must fall to students' spare time or to their extracurricular activities. This is partly explained by departmental traditions and experience, which may not encompass skills development. The UCL Key Skills site model, based on a 'core' website with customised departmental homepages, allows departments to make best use of central resources by 'personalising' the routes into these for their students. It also draws an important distinction in terms of the purpose of the web site, between management of information (for the central site) and pedagogy (for the departmental pages). The model helps to lay the foundations for graduates' lifelong learning by encouraging skills development, within a discipline-specific setting. The benefits of this approach-which included greatly increased levels of engagement and raised awareness amongst staff-are illustrated by a case study from the UCL Geography department, and wider applications of the model as a way of supporting centralised initiatives are discussed.

Ritzer's references to prosumption as a form of eternal return of a 'primal act', which draw on the work of Friedrich Nietzsche and Gilles Deleuze, introduce some ambiguity into the concept. This ambiguity echoes a certain polarization in the debate about co-creation, especially regarding the nature of consumer participation in the creation of value, but it is central to defining the limits of consumer freedom and agency. Critical analysis of UK lifelong learning discourse shows how prosumption can work as a tool of control in this context, producing docile subjectivities, compliant forms of creative co-production and disposable 'nothing' products through repetition and a return of the same. Where prosumption is able to challenge this repetition, however, it involves creativity and the return of difference. These examples show how eternal return, ultimately, underpins prosumption's claim to offer a valid description of emerging practices of prosuming lifelong learners.",2017,17,3,695,712

Published studies on efolios in graduate medical education are mostly descriptions of implementation at individual institutions. Methods: An anonymous online survey was sent to 199 pediatric residency program directors across the United States. Efolio usage patterns were described and compared between program directors that perceived efolios effective at fostering LLL and those that did not. Results: Surveys were completed by 82 of 199 program directors (41%), and 55% used efolios. The 20% (9 of 45) of program directors that believed efolios were effective at teaching LLL more often used self-assessment (88% vs. 50%, p = 0.05) and goal-setting (75% vs. 40%, p = 0.03) functionalities. Common efolio challenges included limited usability and difficulty integrating data. Most non-users (65%) would like to invest in efolios. Conclusions: Respondents reported technical and convenience-related challenges to efolio use, which need to be addressed for efolios to meet their potential as valuable learning tools. The use of self-assessments and goal-setting features was associated with program directors' perceptions that efolios were effective at fostering LLL.",2017,17,,,

However, many find themselves facing intersecting obstacles as they struggle to secure a job. Based on interviews with 18 immigrant settlement workers (16 female, 2 male) who themselves migrated to Canada from 10 different countries, this article investigates how these immigrants navigated the complex path of transition to work. Adopting intersectionality as its theoretical framework and institutional ethnography as its methodology, the qualitative study presented here focused on how race, gender and class intersect in shaping immigrants' experiences of transition to work as a lifelong learning process. The findings reveal that newly arrived immigrants encounter multifaceted structural barriers in their struggle to secure a foothold in the Canadian labour market. These barriers include delays or even refusal in accepting immigrants' prior qualifications, and they are shaped by the intersections of race, gender and class. The study also reveals how immigrants' experiences of employability-oriented lifelong learning unveil institutional complexes and reflect colonising practices among governmental organisations, qualifications assessment agencies, employment institutions and immigrant service agencies. Instead, a decolonising and inclusive strategy is proposed to provide lifelong learning opportunities for all, acknowledge and affirm cultural difference and diversity as desirable assets, and challenge the current ideological moorings of lifelong learning theories, policies and practices in the age of transnational migration.",2021,67,6,733,750

A needs assessment of retirees residents in Heritage Village, a retirement community located in the Niagara. region of Ontario, was conducted to explore the specific educational interests of this particular population. In addition, the most suitable educational approaches, environments, and learning mediums of residents were examined. Five focus groups, each having approximately 6 participants, were conducted with residents. Groups were organized according to maturity (young or old), residential history (within or out of region), and marital status (married or single/windowed). Most participants were found to be interested in education for leisure and personal development, the fatter specifically around health maintenance and quality of life. The educational approaches that were most comfortable with participants centered around adult learning theory. Because transportation was a problem for some participants, on-site learning in the Heritage Village club-house was suggested by many. Experimental learning within a social environment, such as a field trip, was a popular medium discussed, whereas computer learning was seen as less attractive.

In order to understand these decisions, we want to explore: (1) how the young adult's experiences influenced their decision to engage with an LLL programme, (2) what role these programmes played in their biographies and (3) how young adults imagine their future. We use two theoretical lenses to explore these questions: bounded agency and projectivity. A comparative study of these two regions provides insight into how different contextual conditions influence young adults' decisions. We perform three different analyses: of the young people's past trajectories and transitions, of their imagined futures, and of their decision to enrol in the programme.

This was prompted initially by a government response to low levels of literacy in the British adult population, identified by an influential international survey, showing unfavourable comparisons with other European countries. The response to the disclosure that seven million adults in England were not functionally literate saw the creation in 2001 of a national basic skills strategy in England entitled Skills for Life. It is a far-reaching strategy creating a new infrastructure to support adult basic skills learning opportunities over a seven-year period. It also created the entitlement to free basic skills learning opportunities, as a cornerstone to creating national economic competitiveness and social cohesion. Such an entitlement could be interpreted as a commitment to providing wider access to foundation skills for adults who had previously missed out, as part of a lifelong learning agenda. However, a critical reading of the policy texts, and recent funding priorities, show the strategy rooted more in a response to what is perceived as the skills demands of a knowledge economy for global competitiveness than to issues of social inclusion and increased opportunities for lifelong learning. The result of this may well be the creation of new sites of inequality that affect older women and adult ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) learners disproportionately, the very people that are identified as being needed to fill skill gaps in the economy.",2006,32,5,703,717

In-depth biographical interviews were conducted with 145 adults about the effects of learning throughout their lives. In addition, 12 group interviews were conducted with practitioners about their perceptions of the effects of learning upon their students. Participation in lifelong learning had effects upon a range of health outcomes; well-being, protection and recovery from mental health difficulties, and the capacity to cope with potentially stress-inducing circumstances including the onset and progression of chronic illness and disability. These effects were mediated by relatively immediate impacts of learning upon psychosocial qualities; self-esteem, self-efficacy, a sense of purpose and hope, competences, and social integration. Learning developed these psychosocial qualities through extending boundaries, a process which is quintessential to learning. However, not all educational experiences had positive effects upon health outcomes. Provision that generated positive health outcomes matched the interests, strengths and needs of the learner. Provision differed in terms of levels of support and challenge, the type and mix of students, and level and content.

Design/methodology/approach Using a qualitative approach combining critical discourse analysis with a modified Delphi, the authors examined How complementary the CanMEDS and LEADS frameworks are in guiding physician leadership development and practice with the following sub-questions: What are the similarities and differences between CanMEDS and LEADS from: An epistemological and philosophical perspective? The perspective of guiding physician leadership training and practice? How can CanMEDS and LEADS guide physician leadership development from medical school to retirement? Findings Similarities and differences exist between the two frameworks from philosophical and epistemological perspectives with significant complementarity. Both frameworks are founded on a caring ethos and value physician leadership - CanMEDS (for physicians) and LEADS (physicians as one of many professions) define leadership similarly. The frameworks share beliefs in the function of leadership, embrace a belief in distributed leadership, and although having some philosophical differences, have a shared purpose (preparing for changing health systems).

However, role of higher education institute as a learning organization to develop lifelong learning attitudes among young adults has not been discussed much. Parameters that determine lifelong learning among working professionals or school-going children may differ from that of prospective managers studying in business schools. Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have given guidelines on learning organization in higher education context which has not been empirically tested. The present study aims to develop a scale on learning organization based on the OECD guideline. It also aims to explore the impact of learning organization and learning processes on lifelong learning attitude in Indian business schools. Design/methodology/approach The present study develops a multidimensional scale to measure business schools' perceived level of performance as a learning organization from the perspective of faculty. The scale considers a learning organization as a multidimensional second-order construct comprising organizational climate for learning, leadership support for knowledge exchange, support for innovation, applied research environment and vision communication. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) has been used to refine and validate the scale. The study also assesses the impact of business schools' performance as learning organization on perceived learning processes and lifelong learning attitude from the perspective of business school students by using structural equation modeling. Findings The study reveals that a learning organization is characterized by organizational climate for learning, leadership support for knowledge exchange, support for innovation, applied research environment and vision communication. Learning organization determines both perceived learning processes (ss = 0.397) and lifelong learning attitude (ss = 0.259). The relationship between learning organization and lifelong learning partially mediates through learning processes (Sobel's statistics = 1.82, p-value = 0.068, indirect effect = 29%). Lifelong learning is characterized by self-regulated reflective learning with knowledge gained through various sources including virtual sources. Originality/value Literature adequately speaks about various scales on learning organization, but there is no specific scale developed, so far, for higher education institutes. Thus, the unique contribution of the present study is the development of a new scale on learning organization based on OECD guidelines on higher education. The scale has been developed based on survey of faculty members and students of Indian business schools. The scale can be used to assess academicians' perception toward effectiveness of a learning organization.

In this paper, we draw on critical policy analysis to examine 10 Canadian federal government training and employment policies in relation to the government's espoused priorities of innovation and developing a high skills society and economy. Our findings highlight three areas of contradiction: a tension between high skills and low skills policy, a contradictory focus on the socially and economically excluded and included, and the paradox of both an active and passive federal government. Drawing on state theories such as inclusive liberalism and the social investment state, we argue that while a 'highly skilled knowledge economy' may form part of the overall skills discourse, these contradictions raise doubts that it is to become a reality in Canada in the near future.",2011,26,3,381,398

The study empirically compared inputs, processes, outputs, and outcomes of policy implementation in the north, south, northeast, and central regions of Thailand and captured the rigor of policy implementation. Using qualitative research methodology, the study showed that each region had established a networking model among stakeholders differently, with distinct actors as focal points in promoting the policy. North and south were the two regions where the elderly were most active and had contributed substantially in terms of inputs. They had also steered the process of policy implementation through close collaboration with sub-district administrative offices and the establishment of their respective associations for the elderly. The other two regions depended on support from the central government and regional branch of the office of non-formal and informal education. The sharp contrast between the regions led to the conclusion that the direction and pro-activeness in promoting lifelong learning policy for the elderly people in Thailand yielded different policy outputs and outcomes; that policy outputs and outcomes remained at the discretion of key actors within each locality; and that policy output and outcome were also not completely dependent on the top-down direction provided by the national government.",2018,17,1,53,68

Mindful of the aging world population and prospects for rising numbers of seniors from age fifty to seventy-four years old and older seniors age seventy-five years and more, investment in activities and programmes that enable healthy aging is becoming a matter of great political, social and economic importance. The aim is to harness the potential of effective decision-making about the aging process, in order to maintain the functional abilities of people as they age as long as possible in the best conditions. Participation is a very important element in this process. The possibilities are vast; both volunteering and participation in physical, cognitive and social activities improve the quality of life, especially the educational and cultural projects that most developed countries have been developing since the late 1960s, although at different paces and with different ways of implementation, but with the same result in regard to improving opportunities for health and the quality of life. In light of these issues, the importance of bringing education to all people as a right, with particular emphasis on social groups with the greatest difficulties, is considered.

This finding is here examined from the perspective of two important distinctions: (i) between employee skill supply and job skill demand and (ii) between formal and informal training. Less-educated workers may hold jobs with low skill requirements demanding little further formal training because the use of high skills is irrelevant, jobs that moreover provide little informal training. Exploring these issues on representative Swedish survey data using the educational mismatch (overqualified, the rightly qualified and the underqualified) model, we find that job requirements are strongly correlated with the incidence of both formal and informal training. Rather than, as has previously been argued, employee training decisions being the cause of the gap, this suggests that employer decisions regarding how to structure jobs and whom to hire are the primary factors behind the training gap.",2021,52,1,64,81

It is believed that the current technological revolution and the emergence of big data influences and reforms the labor market, as the demand of highly competent people is increasing. Based on these facts, the model of a smarter university can be implemented as an e-learning platform for helping people acquire specific competences or for increasing employability. The development of e-learning doesn't represent the ending of the traditional learning. E-learning should be embedded in the university ecosystem, by connecting it to the university's learning management system. E-learning can be used in parallel with face-to-face courses, combining the tradition with the novelty. Also, nowadays, the learning process is continuous; therefore the term of lifelong learning (LLL) has been created. It refers to the permanent implication in formal and informal education, on a daily basis. Education and learning do not refer only to the formal schooling anymore a person must acquire, evolve and maintain specific knowledge and skills to assure his self education. Although LLL is known to have positive impact on one's employability, its efficiency is hard to prove. Statistics related to graduate unemployment are considered indicators for quantifying educational efficiency. A platform which sustains LLL and, in the same time, connects its users with company and university environments would clearly show the efficiency of LLL for improving professional life of university graduates. In order to check the feasibility of such an idea and materialize it in a concept, a regional study on Danube countries was conducted, within the framework of a joint education project: START-SoPI Project Feasibility Study on Implementing a Pan-European Social Platform to Support Lifelong Learning and Employability. The project was partly financed by START Danube Region Project Fund, while START was financed by the European Union and the City of Vienna. START-SoPI Project had partners from 3 countries from the Danube Region: Romania, Serbia and Austria. The research methodology of START-SoPI project was based on online questionnaires for students and professors (we had 391 validated questionnaires of students and 59 validated questionnaires of professors from various countries), structured interviews with companies' representatives, students, professors and personnel from career development centers (we performed 21 interviews in all three countries) and a focus group organized in Serbia. Qualitative and quantitative analysis was done on the collected data, both proving the benefits brought by the implementation of a lifelong learning platform which connects companies, universities and students.

However, prior research and official statistics show that employees with a lower level of education tend to participate less in training than highly-educated individuals. This limited participation is associated with employers offering fewer opportunities to low-qualified employees, but also with the fact that low-qualified employees themselves might be less willing to participate. In other words, their learning intentions are assumed to be weaker and more restricted than the learning intentions of highly-educated employees. The article reports on a quantitative survey research on the learning intentions of 406 low-qualified employees. The results showed that employees who participated in formal job-related learning activities during the last 5 years had a stronger learning intention than those who did not. Next, the results of the stepwise regression showed that self-directedness, financial benefits, self-efficacy, and autonomy were significant positive predictors of the learning intentions of low-qualified employees. Also, the limited number of possibilities or opportunities to learn was not significant. The results indicated that a learning intention can lead towards the participation in learning activities, but participation is not merely initiated by offering opportunities for learning. Organisational aspects such as job autonomy and financial benefits can stimulate the learning intention of an employee. Finally, regarding the socio-demographic variables, only limited differences were found.

If the raft of new educational initiatives created by the European Union since then is considered along with the redefinition of key terminology in the EQF (i.e. competences) and the delayed rollout of the ECVET credit system, these AQUAT-NET results take on renewed significance, e.g. the admittedly low take-up rate of ECVET credit points. According to Reports and Evaluations on the state of ECVET implementation (e.g. CEDEFOP (2016) and the much later 2019 European Commission study on VET instruments ECVET and EQAVET), both the concept and the definition of ECVET credit points need to be revised (rather than removed). One acknowledged obstacle to the acceptance of the entire ECVET package lay in the absence of a large, well-organised peer learning group able to disseminate up-to-date relevant information. Within the small aquatic sciences sector, the steady flow of information concerning new lifelong learning initiatives to all stakeholders accounted for the success of the AQUA-TNET approach in promoting informed decision-making at the relevant level. This continues to be one of the recommended best practice approaches, while surveys such as ours are relegated to the vast unread mountains of EU studies.",2020,28,5,1825,1836

An analysis of lifelong learning policies and practice in China,ASIA PACIFIC EDUCATION REVIEW,,"Lifelong learning has become a global phenomenon that has significantly reshaped the conventional foundation of national education systems. Lifelong Learning has experienced an evolution that can be identified in two generations: it first emerged in the 1970s and then quickly gained significance and prevalence by the 1990s. There is general consensus that the rise and spread of the lifelong learning concept in the 1990s was propelled by an intensifying process of globalization, which has also greatly shaped the emphasis and agendas that are captured in the concept. Correspondingly, a dominant albeit disputed trend emerged in literature that portrays lifelong learning as serving the global knowledge economy. Based on a review of the discourse on the global forces that affect lifelong learning, this study explores how lifelong learning policies and practices in China are influenced by globalization. It finds that China has adopted broader agendas of lifelong learning than those required by the global forces. This study serves as a first step towards filling the current research gap: there is a lack of studies exploring lifelong learning policies and practices in East Asia, while most of the existing literature on the topic is focused on Western countries.",2017,18,2,219,226

Lifelong learning is a tool for individuals' personal and professional growth it leads to improving their knowledge, skills and competences at any stage of their lives [1]. In the case of working adults, it is also an effective way of finding or keeping their place in the labour market. So, nowadays, it can be considered a necessity. Working adults involved in any form of lifelong learning must cope with a range of specific problems and overcome various barriers during their studies. Many of them are related to the fact that, for working persons, it is difficult to split their time between family, work, and study. As a consequence, they opt for a form of escape academic procrastination. While general procrastination is a needless delay of performing activities which can lead to difficulties in accomplishing tasks within the desired time in any sphere of life, academic procrastination occurs specifically in the context of learning and may have a significant impact on the efficiency of the educational process and the academic achievement of the adult learners. The authors carried out a research on general and academic procrastination on a sample including working adults taking part in tertiary education. Their key findings relevant to the topic are presented in the paper.",2019,,,7146,7151

Yet, despite such enthusiasm, the use of technology to attract adults to lifelong learning is only now beginning to be implemented on a widespread basis. Thus much of the technology-based vision of a 'learning society' remains empirically unproven. This paper, therefore, concentrates on the longer-established efforts being made in Wales to use the Internet as a gateway for learning opportunities for adult learners. Focusing on a Web-based Welsh language programme over a 12 month period the paper empirically examines the role of the Internet in providing effective access procedures to adult learning and, moreover, gains a sense of who such methods are attracting and what learners are beginning to use the Internet for. In particular the paper examines: how the programme was presented on the Internet; when learners were using the Internet-based learning programme and what they were using it for; and, finally, who was accessing the learning programme via the Internet and how usage of the programme reflected the wider goals of extending, participation beyond those social groups already engaged in learning.",2001,38,3,205,219

Results indicate limited faculty knowledge about the lifelong learning auditing program at the college. Many faculty who participated did not understand their own role in the program and offered suggestions to help address these issues within their narratives. For example, faculty recommended more formal structures to acknowledge the work of those faculty who participate in the program, and to engage more professors and older adults in the community to ensure program success.

The study is designed as focused ethnography, drawing upon observation, interviewing, and document analysis. The material is read through the concepts of acceleration and frenetic standstill and contextualized in the discourses on industry 4.0 and recognition of prior learning. The study shows how the notion of constant technological change drives the Czech discourse of adult education, introducing a sense of urgency and pressing for faster developments in the further education of adults. However, the field of adult education exhibits a lack of consistency in its development, translating into absenting sense of progress. Within this context, the Czech National Qualifications Framework (NQF) has produced a steady output of qualification standards even though its internal processes have been prolonged. The tempo of the NQF and the absenting sense of progress can be read as signs of a frenetic standstill, accompanied by a high fluctuation of individuals on all levels of an organizational hierarchy. The study argues that acceleration is not driven by technological change in the observed context as the examined discourses expect. Instead, social acceleration seems to be perpetuating itself as a relatively independent force, eroding institutions that are seen as key in adapting to the incoming transition.",2021,30,3,423,444

The Seventh International Conference on Adult Education (CONFINTEA VII - June 2022) is an excellent opportunity to rethink literacy from a lifelong learning perspective in order to fully tap its transformative potential in the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By using a theoretical framework of lifelong literacy, this article analyses the main challenges associated with applying the lifelong learning principle to literacy, in particular in the context of aligning CONFINTEA's review and improvement of adult learning and education (ALE) strategies with SDG processes. The authors demonstrate that a limited understanding of literacy as part of lifelong learning still prevails, and that literacy promotion suffers from ambiguity and dissonances. They also provide analyses of literacy policies, strategies and programmes that have been successful in adopting a lifelong learning approach, drawing out some important lessons on how this can be achieved. In particular, the authors argue, more attention needs to be paid to the demand side of a literate environment and to motivation, enabling continuity of learning by making literacy part of people's broader learning purposes. To contribute to the ongoing discussion on reframing literacy from a lifelong learning perspective in the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the potential development of a new framework for action during CONFINTEA VII, this article offers three fundamental considerations that should inform policy and strategic planning with regard to conceptual orientation, programmatic responses and institutional connections.",2022,68,2,233,258

A predictive correlational research model was employed to test the proposed hypotheses. A total of 376 undergraduates with diverse backgrounds were surveyed in a central city of Turkey. The mediated-path analysis demonstrated that belief in the impact of reading is a prominent predictor of university students' lifelong learning tendencies. Further, enthusiasm for reading was explored to mediate the link between beliefs in the impact of reading and lifelong learning tendencies.

The following paper presents a framework to integrate the concepts of Corporate Social Responsibility and Human Resource Development to create an approach that can address this responsibility. The concepts of Corporate Social Responsibility and Human Resource Development are linked by the idea of lifelong learning, incorporating concepts and ideas from the field of education into the framework, which makes it possible to examine the issue of promotion and social advancement irrespective of an individual's social background. The article lays a foundation for the framework by describing the concepts named above and later on conceptualizes a three-part framework that helps to analyse the development of entrepreneurial structures that enable social commitment through company education. With this framework, an innovative approach to link a corporation's social and educational engagement for mutual benefit is given an applicable form, with the immanent potential for the development of social sustainability. The research presented in this paper is purely theoretical and its results offer a connection point for practical interventions.",2017,9,9,,

However, as a social status, age remains primarily in the background of older adults' conversations, only being drawn into the focus when one is identified as older. This paper draws on interviews with members and staff of an Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI) in the southeastern United States of America in order to examine the ways that they discuss age and ageing. These older adults' ageing talk often focused on navigating away from negative ideas about age and avoiding labels deemed pejorative. Humour was occasionally used in identifying age, which carried potential for reinforcing as well as subverting ageism. Yet, members highlighted positive value in being older, particularly as demonstrated through participation in age-segregated education. Overall, these findings reflect the conflicting influences of deeply embedded ageist beliefs and personal desires to age successfully among this group of white, upper-middle-class, educated older adults. Ultimately, OLLI served as a protective environment for these privileged individuals, shielding the self from stereotypes otherwise present in ageing talk.",2021,41,4,836,853

We may not even notice it but experience shows that a well-informed and prepared person can assess a situation more realistically, prevent an emergency situation and if needed help not only himself or herself but also his/her family, neighbours, classmates or colleagues. On the basis of that the authors of the study carried out a long-term (2015-2019) research mapping the level of selected competencies in students at the Faculty of Education, Charles University, studying the Secondary School Teaching within the Lifelong Learning Programme. The research study aims to find out whether and to what extent the selected students are competent to protect a person in an emergency situation, understand possible gaps in these competencies and establish corresponding training needs. The research sample consists of 600 students of the Lifelong Learning Programme for the time being. A quantitative method was used (questionnaire) in the research. The respondents completed a questionnaire consisting of two parts. The first part focused on selected attitudes, opinions and experience and the second part contained a didactic test.

Changing downward the educational track of a student is an important alternative to grade retention in secondary education in Flanders and the Netherlands. Based on longitudinal data, we find that young people who at least once repeated a grade in primary or secondary education or changed their educational track downward, attain a lower educational degree than those who progress through their school career without delay or track changes. Furthermore, the educational degree mediates the indirect effect of grade retention and downward track changes on the early occupational career and lifelong learning.

It argues that current discourses in lifelong learning are shaped by neoliberal influences that emphasize individualism, competition, and connections to the marketplace. Critical educators, drawing upon a Habermasian analysis, make some valid critiques of problems with developing an educational agenda shaped by neoliberal values, but their assessment is insufficient for explaining the persistence of gender inequalities within adult education. This is because critical theory does not adequately take up other 'medias' of power, such as patriarchy. A feminist lens is used to explore and complicate the perceptual divisions between the 'public' and 'private' spheres through an examination of three focal points in the homeplace; identity, relationships, and labour. Drawing upon a social science and humanities (SSHRC) research study that looks at women's learning trajectories in Canada, and a Canadian Council on Learning (CCL) grant on women and active citizenship, examples are brought in to support the discussion. From this analysis, recommendations are made for educators, administrators, and policy makers to challenge a neoliberal agenda in lifelong learning and develop a more holistic and gender inclusive approach that troubles commonly accepted parameters of 'public' and 'private' by exploring the significance of the homeplace on adult learning experiences.",2009,31,2,157,172

A survey of 218 students and masters was conducted, data on the most popular and effective forms of knowledge acquisition (experience of formal, nonformal and informal leaming over the past year), plans for further education and career development were collected. The dynamics of learning at different years of study is described. A group of students with pronounced learning and focus on lifelong leaming (45% of the sample) was identified. A comparative analysis of two samples was carried out and qualities that could be considered markers of the LLL orientation were identified: a high level of metacognitive knowledge and metacognitive activity, reflective competence (at the cognitive, metacognitive and personal level), internal involvement in learning, focus on achieving professionalism and personal development, general self-efficacy, the prevalence of progressive and creative motives over consumer ones. Conclusions are drawn about the predominant role of metacognitions and personality determinants in the formation of lifelong learning competency among students. Reflection aimed at recognizing one's own cognitive processes and understanding their contribution to personal development is the main mechanism for the formation of meta-cognitive abilities. The results obtained in the study determine the ways of pedagogical support and psychological intervention to ensure the development of lifelong learning competencies in different categories of students.",2020,8,2,1,14

The emergence of the knowledge society, building on the pervasive influence of modern information and communication technologies, is bringing about a fundamental reshaping of the global economy. In this context, this paper aims to present the results of the recent research related to 'lifelong learning' and 'knowledge society' and to analyze their impact on society. In order to achieve these objectives we proceeded to an exhaustive literature review of the concepts in peer reviewed scientific journals, books, research reports, international conferences, governmental documents and publications from important organizations such as UNESCO, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the Council of Europe, which have put forward the idea and the establishment of lifelong learning and have contributed to its evolution. More concretely, this paper is an attempt to define the broader context of lifelong learning and knowledge society and to identify their main development phases by presenting and comparing the functions and the role of adult education in the past and in the present. Published critique on the evolution of the term lifelong learning is presented from the late 60's until today, showing the main characteristics of adult education in relation to recent literature. Moreover, we present the socioeconomic needs that led to the increasing importance of knowledge and learning in today's society.

Today, Internet is one of the technologies used to teach and to learn in educational contexts all over the world, being an undeniable tool to access and exchange information, to participate, to improve learning processes including those related to personal competences. However, there is a lack of information regarding Digital Identity (DI) construction as a competence, especially when related to high school students.

On the one hand, a responsible construction and management of a DI can prevent not only digital crimes (such as hacking, copyright felonies, privacy policies violations), but also can prevent from dangerous online relationships, cyberbullying or other types of digital violence. On the other hand, a well-constructed DI can motivate a healthy identity construction (online and offline), can stimulate participation, citizenship and construction of strong communities that can and would influence the life of each and every student nowadays.

In this chapter, which is an expansion of our previous research, we present a definition of lifelong learning in medicine and report the psychometrics and correlates of an instrument (Jefferson Scale of Physician Lifelong Learning, JeffSPLL) that we began to develop in 2001 to specifically measure orientation toward lifelong learning among physicians. We collected survey data from 3,195 physicians who were classified into three groups: Full-time clinicians (n=1,127), academic clinicians (n=1,612), and others (n=456). The three underlying components of the JeffSPLL resulted from factor analysis including: learning beliefs and motivation, attention to learning opportunities, and skills in seeking information. These factors correspond to the key features of lifelong learning often described in the literature, thus providing support for the construct validity of the JeffSPLL. Significant correlations between the JeffSPLL scores and the criterion measures of commitment to lifelong learning, learning motivation, information seeking skills, professional accomplishments, career satisfaction, and academic performance support the criterion-related validity of the JeffSPLL for both full-time clinicians and academic clinicians. The reliability coefficients (coefficient alpha and test-retest) of the JeffSPLL ranged from 0.72 to 0.86 in both groups of physicians. Implications of the findings in monitoring the outcomes of educational programs, and investigating differences across academic medical centers and groups of physicians are discussed. If a medical degree is considered to be an indication of the completion of learning, it should be given at the time of a physician's retirement. Until then a physician is a student with a moral, ethical, and legal obligation to continue learning. (Gonnella, Callahan, Louis, Hojat, & Erdmann, 2004, p.10).",2010,,,37,78

First, we describe the SI and LLL perspectives, reviewing their foundations and main principles. These approaches present overlaps, but also differences related to the scope and aims of interventions. Moreover, both the critical debates on SI and LLL stress the relevance of ambiguities that can be traced back to the existence of a narrower functionalistic understanding and market-lead human capital approach. This view is contrasted with a holistic comprehension of inclusion taking into account issues of social participation and human capabilities. Second, we discuss institutional and contextual complementarities as preconditions for the effectiveness of SI policies, to be identified in the complex and time-framed interface among the labour market, the education system and the welfare state. By doing this, we argue that LLL policies play a key role in a social investment strategy, specifically addressing the time dimension by means of coherent interventions over the life course. We suggest that further research may investigate, according to this conceptual framework, the specific combinations of SI and LLL policies within different national contexts.",2018,50,2,203,218

In contrast to hard skills or cognitive ability, which are the mainstream of formal and informal education, NCS is yet to be recognised and measured in academic curriculums, despite that many studies have shown the importance of NCS in building the character of a person. The system requirements and design architecture for an ICT solution are sought in this study that can quantify and assess NCS. A Design Science Approach (DSA) is followed in systematically eliciting the requirements and hence the functionalities and main modules of the ICT enabler. The resulting artefact includes the functionalities for a dashboard that the personal profile and skills of users can be visualised, and a matching system of NCS required for prospective occupations, together with a recommender system that can recommend courses to acquire NCS. The requirements were elicited and refined, starting in a co-creation session with project stakeholders from six European countries. The elicited requirements from the co-creation session were validated by pilots consisting of 190 participants from three European countries. Finally, the results were transformed into wireframes, and, ranked based on the perceptions of the end-user focus group participants, refined by the experts in the field.

However, in response to changes in the contemporary cultural context, the latter are now transforming into a reflexive epistemology and ethic of authenticity, raising the prospect of a number of morally disabling tendencies, the recognition and avoidance of which emerges as an imperative for the future of the field.",2022,41,1,60,75

Method Between December 2014 and February 2015, 105 of 173 (61%) eligible psychiatry residents from the Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, completed a questionnaire with three study instruments: an LLL needs assessment survey, the Jefferson Scale of Physician Lifelong Learning (JeffSPLL), and the Academic Motivation Scale (AMS). The AMS included a relative autonomy motivation score (AMS-RAM) measuring the overall level of intrinsic motivation (IM). Results A significant correlation was observed between JeffSPLL and AMS-RAM scores (r = 0.39, P < .001). Although there was no significant difference in JeffSPLL and AMS-RAM scores based on respondents' level of training (senior vs. junior resident), gender, or age, analysis of AMS subdomains showed that junior residents had a significantly higher score on the extrinsic motivation identification domain (mean difference [M] = 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.01, 0.75]; P =.045; d = 0.44) compared with senior residents. Clinician scientist stream (CSS) residents had significantly higher JeffSPLL scores compared with non-CSS residents (M = 3.15; 95% CI [0.52, 5.78]; P = .020; d = 0.57). Conclusions The use of rigorous measures to study LLL and academic motivation confirmed prior research documenting the positive association between IM and LLL. The results suggest that postgraduate curricula aimed at enhancing IM, for example, through support for learning autonomously, could be beneficial to cultivating LLL in learners.",2016,91,10,1423,1430

It focuses on adults' numeracy and discusses its conceptualisation and assessment in the Project for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), which is the most recent survey. Drawing on critical theoretical resources about new forms of governance in education and transformations in the pedagogic discourse, the paper further substantiates existing critiques of global policy trends, namely that they are motivated by human capital approaches to education and LLL. In particular, we show that the apparently commonsensical appeal of evaluative instruments like PISA and PIAAC is based on a competency model of knowledge, which embodies a narrow notion of competence. Relatedly, the notional curricula promoted by such surveys potentially articulate a more radical idea of LLL, captured by Bernstein's conception of trainability as the mode of socialisation into a Totally Pedagogised Society. The paper presents a dual approach to understanding international adult performance surveys in general-in that, besides deploying the theoretical resources already indicated, it also raises a number of methodological issues relevant to the valid interpretation of these studies' results. Ultimately, it argues for the importance of mobilising resources from critical educational perspectives to support the development of potentially powerful knowledge like numeracy and to prevent its being reduced to a narrow competency.",2014,87,2,167,186

The aim is to analyse how health operates as a governing technique in discourses of lifelong learning. Within such current discourses the population is today described as generally well-educated and healthy, but not educated or healthy enough. When constructed as being in need of enhancement, measures of learning are suggested for regulating certain groups of the population into becoming what is regarded as desirable. Making use of Foucault's notions of governmentality and genealogy, white and green papers from the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs from 1930s and today (2017) are analysed. The analysis shows that although the population is described as having different problems originating from ignorance, the solutions that are suggested in the different time periods are basically the same. The relation between learning and health is described in different ways in the 1930s and the present. In the 1930s learning is explained merely as a means to achieve a healthy population while in the present health is described both as a prerequisite and as an effect of learning. Further, there is also a difference in how the governing is conducted.",2019,38,3,287,300

The terms lifelong education - lifelong learning and lifelong learning have become the basic concepts of the modern policy of teaching democracy and developing human resources in a multipolar world. This is precisely what contributes to the formation and improvement of skills in the field of professional communication using the knowledge of several foreign languages, as well as the development of competence in the field of citizenship. The aim of the study of the authors of this article is to study the influence of the potential of non-formal (any extracurricular foreign-language educational) activity on the formation of lifelong learning ability among law students at the Department of Foreign Languages of the Law Institute of the Peoples' Friendship University of Russia. The basis of the materials of the study was data from a survey of Russian and foreign students enrolled in the undergraduate program. In the course of the study, comparative, inductive-empirical and hypothetical deductive methods were used, as well as sampling and pragmatic interpretation of text material. The research methodology included questionnaires and statistical data processing. The authors paid attention to the issue of the mutual influence of the processes of education (as a social action) and training (as the acquisition of knowledge, skills and abilities necessary for the labor market) on the formation of such competency-based components as citizenship, intercultural communication ability, multilingualism, diversity of perspectives and social activity. The results of the study obtained by the authors indicate that the above abilities are acquired by students in different learning contexts and are not limited to the strict scope of classroom studies and the capabilities of the curriculum disciplines. This is proved by the data obtained from a survey of sophomore students on the number of hours spent in the classroom and at a computer (smartphone, tablet) outside the university. A special place in the study is devoted to the problem of the correlation of the importance of certification as an element of formal education (obtaining a university diploma, certificate of completion of professional education) and validation, which reveals the diversity of the palette of acquired competencies (international certificates confirming the level of knowledge of foreign languages for communicative and professional goals, certificates of participants in various language programs and courses, obtaining grants and confirmation of participation in various competitions and competitions).

Machine Learning Algorithms Find No Evidence to Differentiate Between Lifelong Bilingual and Monolingual Cognitive Profiles,FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE,,"Bilingualism has been identified as a potential cognitive factor linked to delayed onset of dementia as well as boosting executive functions in healthy individuals. However, more recently, this claim has been called into question following several failed replications. It remains unclear whether these contradictory findings reflect how bilingualism is defined between studies, or methodological limitations when measuring the bilingual effect. One key issue is that despite the claims that bilingualism yields general protection to cognitive processes (i.e., the cognitive reserve hypothesis), studies reporting putative bilingual differences are often focused on domain specific experimental paradigms. This study chose a broader approach, by considering the consequences of bilingualism on a wide range of cognitive functions within individuals. We utilised 19 measures of different cognitive functions commonly associated with bilingual effects, to form a cognitive profile for 215 non-clinical participants. We recruited Welsh speakers, who as a group of bilinguals were highly homogeneous, as means of isolating the bilingualism criterion. We sought to determine if such analyses would independently classify bilingual/monolingual participant groups based on emergent patterns driven by collected cognitive profiles, such that population differences would emerge. Multiple predictive models were trained to independently recognise the cognitive profiles of bilinguals, older adults (60-90 years of age) and higher education attainment. Despite managing to successfully classify cognitive profiles based on age and education, the model failed to differentiate between bilingual and monolingual cognitive ability at a rate greater than that of chance. Repeated modelling using alternative definitions of bilingualism, and just the older adults, yielded similar results. In all cases then, using our bottom-up analytical approach, there was no evidence that bilingualism as a variable indicated differential cognitive performance - as a consequence, we conclude that bilinguals are not cognitively different from their monolingual counterparts, even in older demographics. We suggest that studies that have reported a bilingual advantage (typically recruiting immigrant populations) could well have confounded other key variables that may be driving reported advantages. We recommend that future research refine the machine learning methods used in this study to further investigate the complex relationship between bilingualism and cognition.",2021,15,,,

A well as analysing good practice examples from the EU universities, this article presents the results of the conducted analysis of already existing activities related to the domain of this project at the University of Novi Sad. Moreover, the strategy elements of the University Interface Centre are presented, together with the implementation and development of the action plan, including, among others, the necessary resources, the organization design and the legal aspects of management and governance. The authors present in detail the primary objectives, tasks and functions of the organized Interface Centre and its integrated parts: the Centre for Lifelong Learning, the Centre for Career Development and Student Counselling, and the Alumni Club. Identification of the Interface Centre's information requirements is the authors' specific contribution to the realisation of the institutional framework and functioning of the Higher Education - Society Cooperation.",2013,,,2409,2417

A PROFESSIONALIZING APPROACH IN LIFELONG LEARNING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BARCELONA (IL3-UB),EDULEARN13: 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES,EDULEARN Proceedings,"Nowadays few would question the determining role played by the workplace as an unsurpassable educational setting to acquire new knowledge and put many different competences into practice. It is a fact that continuing professional education constitutes one of the basic tools of professional development (Eraut, 1994). However, it is equally true that daily experience in the workplace, everyday professional practice, also constitutes one of the most powerful sources of knowledge, although often, when it comes to practical knowledge acquired through experience, people cannot easily tell you what it is that they know. (Eraut, 1994: 25). Beyond the acquisition of technical or technological knowledge to be applied to specific problems, work process knowledge implies a more complex and integrated vision of the own organization and of what occurs there in terms of learning. It involves a type of knowledge which grows exponentially, feeding back from the results of each professional's performance in the work field. There, words, thoughts and actions, which flow from the interaction between what the person already knows and the new generated by the workplace, find their place (Fischer & Boreman, 2004). Most students at IL3-UB pursue the interest of learning to find a new job or to improve their labour conditions. Thus, the professional approach is the backbone of the learning process at IL3-UB to help our students to gain labour experience while they are being trained. Our aim is to contribute to our students' employability. Results are measured by participants in terms of professional development and by their enterprises in terms of business impact. The main characteristic of new programmes are work-based activities defined in IL3-UB such as those challenges emerging from professional practice; centred in work-based needs of the professional profile; oriented to train complex labour situations; connected to professional sector contents; oriented to develop concrete professional competences; and searching to create informal learning processes to explicit the tacit knowledge. This approach made our design and our teaching process redefined. We have rewritten our training project in order to position professional learning as the core of our formative model. The institution is currently being transformed to meet the organizational and the business needs, internal teams are being trained and the model is being implemented in new long programmes. It is a middle-term team project made by the joint effort of the whole IL3-UB employees, some external collaborators and the invaluable contribution of the teacher's team.",2013,,,1884,1891

This paper uses a grounded approach to explore and assess critical geragogical elements that are enabling, empowering and transformative for older learners. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 48 participants who had completed an NSA course. Although three different categories of older learners were identified in this study, most tend to internalize ageism and took courses to counter ageist stereotypes of being frail, dependent and useless. In terms of geragogy, participants articulated four key learning needs at the NSA. These were: (i) relatable, empathetic and engaging instructors; (ii) interactive and versatile methods of teaching with emphasis on real-life applications; (iii) flexible and accessible curriculum and course content appropriate to learners' capabilities and expectations and (iv) inclusive and disability-friendly learning environments catering to a wide spectrum of learners. At the NSA, instructors are crucial to the empowerment of older learners by leading the challenge against ageism, promoting learners' confidence and self-worth as well as enabling safe spaces for personal transcendence and creative expression. This study reinforces the need for more contextualized models of geragogy to dismantle structural and internalized forms of ageism by taking into account older learners' cultural beliefs about aging, access to education, confidence and competences to navigate both formal and informal learning environments.",2020,46,10,628,641

Overcoming the complex challenges of this shift will require engineers to display agility, resilience, intrinsic drive, and an ability to continually grow and develop-capacities that are currently underemphasized in engineering degree programs. Despite a growing recognition of the importance of socially responsible technological development, many engineering programs continue to prioritize decontextualized technical content learning over broad competency development. As a result, students may have difficulty identifying either personal or societal value in their engineering activities. Wesuggest that the integration of engineering and humanities perspectives can help students situate their technical studies within the larger human system while simultaneously offering measurable improvements in students' motivations and lifelong learning skills. In this paper, we report findings from an investigation of the effects of disciplinary integration on student motivation and learning engagement in introductory materials science courses. The quantitative results show that integrating materials science with humanities through a project-based course effectively supports increased student motivation and engagement in self-regulated learning strategies. Compared to students in non-integrated project-based courses, students in integrated project-based courses show higher intrinsic motivation and task value. Students in the integrated materials science-history course also report significantly higher use of critical thinking strategies in their project work, indicating that an emphasis on societal context may help students cognitively engage in their engineering studies. Findings also indicate that disciplinary integration offers particular benefits to women engineering students. Compared with the non-integrated course, women in the integrated course report more significant motivational and self-regulated learning gains. This research suggests that putting human contexts at the center of engineering learning can help all engineering students, and especially women engineering students, build a sense of societal relatedness that promotes better learning.",2015,31,1,434,449

Self-efficacy has traditionally been understood to be developed through the direct experience of competence, the vicarious experience of competence, social persuasion, and physiological cues. These four factors, and particularly the first two, are difficult to build into education and training programs in a context where changing skills make the specific meaning of graduate competence largely unknown and, notwithstanding the other contributions in this collection, largely unknowable. In response, in this paper we argue for a working metacognitive model of career self-efficacy that will prepare students with the skills needed to evaluate their skills, attitudes and values and then adapt and develop them as their career context evolves around them. The model we will present is one of evolving complex sub-systems within an emergent milieu. In identifying various contributing factors, the model provides specific cognitive and affective constructs as important targets for actionable learning analytics for career development.",2023,6,,,

It has become crucial to train the rural labour force to become modern professional farmers who are knowledgeable, skilled, and well-versed in the latest agricultural management techniques. To make this process a success, it has been key to understand the extent of their willingness to participate in training, as this significantly affects the quality of the training. This study aims to analyse what influences rural labourers' willingness to attend new professional farmers' training (NPFT) by selecting four factors, namely (1) individual characteristics; (2) economic capital; (3) educational opportunity; and (4) technological perception. After conducting a survey among samples of the local population in three counties of Shaanxi Province, the authors applied a binary logistic regression model to data from 543 completed questionnaires. The result showed that the willingness of agricultural labourers to participate in NPFT is impacted by factors including age, size of farm, total annual household income, and training experience. These findings suggest that the NPFT programme should be improved by paying more attention to the needs of agricultural labourers, increasing capital investment, establishing a diversified investment system, and mobilising the enthusiasm of rural labourers.",2019,65,4,579,604

Historically, male students from working-class backgrounds have often struggled with identity issues and many leave school early for vocational employment where their masculinity is reinforced and validated. A small percentage, however, re-enrol in higher education later in life. This paper explores how Deo, a tradesperson who became a university student, reconstructed his identity during this transition. Design/methodology/approach - The primary methodology for this case study is semi-structured interviews. Findings - Deo articulated his transition in terms of change and transformation, in which a theme of risk was central. He also drew attention to cultural practices that regulate hierarchies of masculinity as they intersect with the identities of age, sexuality, ethnicity and socio-economic status within his work and study. Research limitations/implications - This study focusses on one student's experience in an Australian public university, so findings may not be generalisable. However, single stories are an important means of illustrating the intersection of shared socio-cultural practices. Originality/value - Within adult education literature there is limited engagement with intersecting cultural narratives that shape experiences, inequalities and barriers in learners' lives Deo's story gives voice to socio-cultural narratives around masculinity, age, ethnicity, sexuality and socio-economic status, highlighting their central significance to learning, being and belonging.",2018,60,6,608,619

In the context of lifelong learning, decolonisation would achieve four important purposes.

Second, decolonisation would entail challenging the hegemony of western knowledge, education, and credentials and upholding a multiculturalism of knowledge' that is inclusive and responsive to the cultural needs and values of transnational migrants. Third, decolonisation would lead to the need for planning and designing learning curricula as well as institutionalised pedagogy based on non-western knowledge systems and epistemic diversity.

The relationship of academic rigor with critical thinking skills and lifelong learning motivations,HIGHER EDUCATION,,"While previous research has examined outcomes related to academic rigor, mixed findings have resulted from differing conceptualizations of rigor as well as varying methodological approaches. Defining rigor as those in-class practices and assignments that require students to engage in deep learning and demonstrate cognitive complexity, we use longitudinal student-level data from 46 four-year institutions in the USA to examine the relationship of academic rigor with undergraduate development of critical thinking skills and two aspects of self-motivated learning (need for cognition and positive attitudes towards literacy). We find that academic rigor is positively related to both aspects of self-motivated learning at the end of the first year of college, with an advantage for students who enter college with low ACT scores and those with less positive attitudes about reading and writing. Rigor is positively related to all three outcomes at the end of the fourth year, with the magnitude of these relationships tending to increase from the first year to the fourth year. Further, by disaggregating the composite measure of rigor into subscales that separate rigorous in-class practices from rigorous exams and assignments, we find that the relationship between rigor and intellectual development is sometimes driven by one form of rigorous practice, with in-class rigor especially benefitting the critical thinking skills of first-generation students.

Our results clearly indicate that the skill levels of more than 50% of adults aged 16-64 years old seem to be insufficient to cope effectively in TRE. The findings suggest that the learning ecologies of adults are a combination of formal, non-formal and informal learning activities. The overall level of problem-solving skills in TRE was higher among individuals who indicated that they have participated either formal or non-formal learning activities, compared to those who have not. However, interestingly, the association between formal learning and problem-solving skills in TRE was not major. Instead, our results clearly indicate that informal learning seems to be highly associated with sufficient problem-solving skills in TRE. In practice, we outline those formal, non-formal and informal learning activities that adults perform when applying the skills in TRE. By recognising these activities undertaken by sufficient problem solvers, we can promote lifelong learning skills.

First, the concept of lifelong learning, and particularly lifelong language learning, is explained in the light of its social benefits, such as inclusion, activating learner potential, as well as personal benefits, including the increase of self-esteem and a sense of agency. Second, the University of Malaga programme, Aula de Mayores, is briefly presented, taking into account its duration, membership and organizational characteristics. Finally, personal reflections based on teaching English to pre-intermediate and intermediate older learners are presented, with a particular emphasis on affective aspects of the teacher-student relationships. In addition to identifying specific learning difficulties and reflecting upon effective (and less so) teaching strategies to remedy them, this paper addresses such concepts as personal motivation, cultural beliefs, and self-concept as instrumental in shaping the older learner's language learning experience and the teacher's role in the reinforcement of those beliefs and personal narratives that may contribute to a positive learning experience. As this paper hopes to demonstrate, respect, understanding, empathy, and personalised encouragement lie at the core of a successful lifelong learning experience, increasing the chances of students' continuing their language education and fostering a sense of satisfaction which the acquisition of linguistic and cultural knowledge, and practical language skills brings.",2019,,,3939,3945

The association between advanced training and education on PLL methods, pharmacy organization membership, and salary are explored. DATA SOURCES: Pertinent literature was identified by MEDLINE searches (1966-1992). STUDY DESIGN: The results of a Fall 1991 survey of recent B.S. pharmacy graduates (n=371) of the University of Wisconsin School of Pharmacy are reported (55 percent response rate). RESULTS: Hospital pharmacists devoted more time to PLL outside of work (18.00 +/- 17.89 h/mo) than community pharmacists (9.93 8.76 h/mo), t=5.02, degrees of freedom (df)=289, p < 0.001. Graduates who had completed an advanced degree program, residency, or fellowship (advanced degree/training [ADT]) spent more time in PLL (17.76 +/- 10.63 h/mo) compared with graduates who had only obtained a B.S. degree (10.63 +/- 8.56 h/mo), t=3.80, df=311, p<0.001. Graduates who had ADT were more likely to belong to multiple pharmacy organizations (2.14 +/- 1.38 organizations) than hospital pharmacists (1.61 +/- 1.27 organizations) and community pharmacists (1.11 +/- 1.06 organizations). Of the pharmacists who graduated in 1989 and 1990 (one to two years postgraduation), 55 percent belonged to the American Pharmaceutical Association. This declined to 19 percent of the graduates from 1984 and 1985 (six to seven years postgraduation), a 62 percent decline in membership. Membership in the American Society of Hospital Pharmacists (ASHP) was held by 19 percent of graduates one to two years after graduation; and 34 percent of graduates belonged to ASHP six to seven years after graduation, an 81 percent increase. Graduates with ADT (compared with graduates with the B.S. degree only) showed the strongest correlation of membership affiliation, which was about equal with ASHP (phi=0.32) and ACCP (phi=0.33). Although pharmacists changed their individual pharmacy organization memberships during the first seven years after graduation, there was no evidence of a decline in overall interest in pharmacy organization membership. Pharmacists who had completed ADT had an annual mean salary of $51 112 +/- $10 012; those pharmacists who did not complete an ADT program had an annual mean salary of $46 440 +/- $7802, a difference of $4672 per year. Hospital pharmacists who had obtained ADT had an annual mean salary of $51 840 +/- $9765; B.S. pharmacists without ADT in hospital practice had an annual mean salary of $43 603 +/- $8192, a difference of $8237 per year.

However, healthcare professionals often report barriers such as access to CPD and cost which limit uptake. Further research is required to assess how accessible CPD programs, such as those delivered virtually, impact orientation to LLL. Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (Project ECHO (R)) is a CPD model that has a growing body of evidence demonstrating improvements in knowledge and skills. Central to this model is the use of a virtual platform, varied teaching approaches, the promotion of multi-directional learning and provider support through a community of practice. This study aimed to explore whether participation in a provincial mental health ECHO program had an effect on interprofessional healthcare providers' orientation to LLL. Methods Using a pre-post design, orientation to LLL was measured using the Jefferson Scale of Lifelong Learning. Eligible participants were healthcare professionals enrolled in a cycle of ECHO Ontario Mental Health from 2017 to 2020. Participants were classified as 'high' or 'low' users using median session attendance as a cut-point. Results The results demonstrate an increase in orientation to LLL following program participation (Pre: 44.64 +/- 5.57 vs. Post: 45.94 +/- 5.70, t (66) = - 3.023, p < .01, Cohen's d = 0.37), with high ECHO users demonstrating greater orientation to LLL post-ECHO.

SBL enables and highlights behaviors, skills and attributes and can be used to identify weakness and implement improvements in a controlled and safe environment. Adverse contrast media reactions, namely severe ones, present a low occurrence, making management in those situations a great target for lifelong and SBL training. The main goal was to develop, implement and evaluate an SBL opportunity on adverse contrast media reactions management for all team of the radiology department. Educational objectives were to enhance and develop technical, problem-solving and interpersonal skills as well as to implement teamwork values. Methods: Participants were divided into 2 sessions performed in 2 different days (8 hours per session). The training program included basic life support and 2 clinical simulation scenarios. Clinical simulation scenarios (moderate and severe anaphylactic reaction) were constructed based on a Portuguese Guideline for Anaphylaxis management in healthcare institutions. In each session participants were divided in 2 independent groups that perform similar scenarios alternately. After the participants were introduced to the context, they were informed that they would work in a scenario where a Computed Tomography (CT) scan with contrast media administration was performed. Half group participated actively in the simulation scenario while the remaining group could attend it remotely through the internal video system. At the end everyone had participated in the discussion of learning. All participants gave their free and informed consent to participate in the survey and to record images. Before and after the experience, participants answered a questionnaire, using a 5-point Likert scale. Results: The course had a total of 37 participants (21 radiographers, 10 operational assistants, 3 radiologists and 3 nurses) of the Radiology department. Before the course, participants were very motivated (4.39 +/- 0.82) but assumed that they had little experience when leading with emergencies (2.25 +/- 1.10) and low level of knowledge in their management (2.65 +/- 0.92). After the course, participants reported an improvement on their level of knowledge (3.71 +/- 0.65). All participants considered that their experience increased after the course and their motivation regarding new clinical simulations was very high (4.68 +/- 0.61). Conclusions: High-fidelity simulation of contrast media adverse reactions improve the level of knowledge and hands-on experience of all participants, which can lead to the improvement of patient management in anaphylactic reactions in clinical practice. The motivation to participate in new clinical simulation scenarios was very high because they promote efficient coordination, share experiences between specialties and professions and optimize individual and team function during an adverse event. So, the use of a SBL can replicate day-to-day experience and empower multidisciplinary teams in a safe environment.",2018,,,2332,2338

Using three existing questionnaires (the Teaching Beliefs Scale, the Effective Lifelong Learning Inventory, and the Change Tendencies Scale), the research team collected responses from 288 teachers (147 female, 141 male) serving in public secondary schools in the province of Karaman, Turkey. In their analysis of the data, the researchers found a significant negative relationship between teachers' traditional (teacher-centred) teaching belief, change tendencies and lifelong learning affinity; whereas the relationship between a constructivist (student-centred) teaching belief, change tendencies and lifelong learning affinity turned out to be significantly positive. The results seem to indicate that change tendencies fully mediate the relationship between teaching beliefs and lifelong learning affinity.

One of the most important ways to adapt to change in the developing and changing health care environment worldwide and in evidence based nursing care is lifelong learning. The most essential characteristics of a lifelong learner are reflection, questioning, enjoying learning, understanding the dynamic nature of knowledge and engaging in learning by actively seeking learning opportunities so that evidence-based nursing care can be achieved. Pediatric nurses were included in this descriptive, correlational and cross-sectional study. The study was based on pediatric nursing in the pediatric clinics of a hospital in the capital of Turkiye between April and July 2021. It was determined that the mean scores of lifelong learning differed according to gender, education level, length of service in the profession and the unit in which each individual worked, and these differences were statistically significant. Pediatric nurses' lifelong learning level explained the three subdimensions of self-confidence in clinical decision-making. The results of the regression analysis indicate that lifelong learning levels of the pediatric nurses did not significantly predict their scores on the subdimensions of anxiety with clinical decision-making scale. Positive effects on clinical decision-making in the nursing process can be achieved if the tendencies of pediatric nurses toward lifelong learning are sufficient. Assessing nurses' lifelong learning perceptions is an essential step toward implementing evidence-based care for pediatric patients.

This raises the question: How is an understanding of the global concept of lifelong learning enriched by a study of such learning in the Global South? This article examines the circumstances surrounding local language literacy in Africa, and suggests that the associated literacy practices help us to refine the concept of lifelong learning. The data for this article are taken from interviews the authors conducted in Ethiopia, Kenya, Cameroon, Ghana and Burkina Faso with 95 adults who had completed local-language literacy instruction within the previous 20 years and who were asked to identify the changes in their lives that had come about after learning to read, write and calculate in their own language. The study provides compelling evidence that lifelong learning has a local reality separate from the global discourse. It contributes to understandings of lifelong learning, demonstrating that once people learn to read in their own language, their literacy skills continue to serve them for engaging in new, literacy-based learning throughout the rest of their lives. Important knowledge from outside of the local community also becomes accessible to them, contributing further to lifelong learning. Thus Northern institutions committed to expanding the lifelong learning options of adults in the Global South must recognise that lifelong learning is significantly enhanced by local-language literacy programming and publication. ResumeSavoir local, savoir mondial: influence de l'alphabetisation en langues locales sur l'apprentissage tout au long de la vie dans les contextes ruraux d'Afrique - L'apprentissage tout au long de la vie est un concept bien etabli dans l'enseignement international, et le discours sur le sujet sous-entend qu'il est applicable a l'echelle mondiale. Il a cependant lieu dans des contextes locaux specifiques aux caracteristiques distinctes telles que langue, site et contenu. Ce fait souleve la question suivante: Dans quelle mesure une interpretation du concept mondial d'apprentissage tout au long de la vie peut etre enrichi par une etude menee sur ce concept dans l'hemisphere Sud ? Les auteurs de cet article examinent les circonstances de l'alphabetisation en langues locales en Afrique et avancent que les pratiques de l'ecrit associees nous aident a affiner le concept d'apprentissage tout au long de la vie. Les donnees collectees pour cet article proviennent d'interviews menees par les auteurs dans plusieurs pays (Ethiopie, Kenya, Cameroun, Ghana et Burkina Faso) avec 95 adultes ayant acheve au cours des 20 dernieres annees un programme d'alphabetisation en langue locale. Ils ont ete pries de definir les changements intervenus dans leur vie apres leur apprentissage de la lecture, de l'ecriture et du calcul dans leur langue. L'etude fournit des preuves convaincantes que l'apprentissage tout au long de la vie connait une realite locale distincte du discours mondial. Elle contribue a elaborer des interpretations de l'apprentissage tout au long de la vie en demontrant que lorsque les individus apprennent a lire dans leur langue, leurs competences lettrees continuent a leur etre utiles leur vie durant pour entamer de nouveaux apprentissages a partir de ces bases. Ils accedent en outre a des informations importantes provenant de l'exterieur de la communaute locale, ce qui contribue egalement a l'apprentissage tout au long de la vie. Les institutions de l'hemisphere Nord consacrees a multiplier les opportunites d'apprentissage tout au long de la vie pour adultes dans l'hemisphere Sud doivent par consequent reconnaitre que cette forme d'apprentissage est considerablement valorisee par une programmation de l'alphabetisation en langues locales ainsi que par un travail de publication afferent.",2019,65,3,409,425

But it has been argued that lifelong learning could provide second chances for these people through providing an alternative route to high qualifications. The main objective of this article is to examine this issue. We pose two questions. Does further education enable individuals from disadvantaged origins but with a high level of cognitive ability to improve on their initial levels of qualification? And does any such improvement then lead to better labour market positions, in terms of social class, for these individuals? Based on the complete qualification histories of individuals in the 1970 British Birth Cohort Study, our analyses show that men and women from disadvantaged origins, especially if of high ability, are indeed able to raise their levels of qualification, but they do so mainly via the attainment of further vocational, rather than further academic, qualifications. And while our results also indicate that acquiring further academic qualifications does improve the upward mobility chances of people of high ability from disadvantaged backgrounds, a similar effect does not show up from acquiring further vocational qualifications. In addition, we find that there remains a substantial direct effect' of cognitive ability on class attainment. This suggests that obtaining further academic qualifications is only one channel for upward mobility and that there are others which are more directly related to ability.",2019,35,1,49,64

This postgraduate degree (30 ETCS credits) is mainly composed of lectures, workshops and field trips, and includes a final presentation and discussion of an applied project. It also includes the option of realizing an internship programme in different companies, institutions and NGOs. Students and professionals from different areas of knowledge take part in the course and learn on sustainability together with an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary panel of teachers. In order to analyze students' satisfaction on the course, determine the rate of employment of post-students in jobs related to sustainability and analyze if the course has provoked them a lifelong learning towards sustainability, we conducted a survey on post-students. 48% of the students of the seven editions answered the survey. Results show that students' satisfaction on the course is high. What students liked most of the course is its interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary character, the great variety and quality of teachers from different professional backgrounds and with expertise in diverse sustainability subjects, the opportunity to make professional contacts, the active participation of the group, the internship programmes and the final applied project. 90% of student made an internship programme in different companies, institutions or NGOs. 92% of them said that they learned a lot in those work practices. With regard to employability, 50% consider that this postgraduate has served them to find a job related to sustainability. Moreover, 15% of the students that made an internship programme were employed in those same companies, and 75% of them are still working there (some of them have worked for over 5 years in the same company where they made the work practices within the postgraduate course). Post-students declare (88%) that this course has provoke them a reflection on attitudes and values towards sustainability. They have made a change of habits for a more sustainable lifestyle thanks to what they learned, reflected and practiced during the course. Now they recycle more, they make a more responsible consumption and they apply sustainability criteria at their workplaces. In conclusion, our study results show that this postgraduate course provides a lifelong learning towards sustainability with real employability opportunities. Its transdisciplinary character, its practical approach that seeks to find solutions to real problems and the active cooperation between the University and the private and public sectors, contributes to create social network towards a more sustainable present and future. Now that this postgraduate course has became a Master Degree (60 ETCS credits), we will use the lessons learned over this seven years, together with the recommendations extracted from this study, to maintain and improve the achieved quality standards.",2017,,,10313,10318

IT education in business can be represented as a combination of academic and professional knowledge, skills and abilities that allow satisfying business needs and performing tasks in line with business requirements. Lifelong learning is an important step in the life of every individual that is now readily available, and can mean a major breakthrough in professional work or a complete change of business orientation. Lifelong learning refers not only to the time and training on the job, but also includes the time before, during and after the working life of every individual who care about their cultural, social and professional development. Capacity development of Croatian public institutions is supported through a number of important projects in the field of information and communication technologies at the national level. Career development and promotion in the civil service is closely associated with continuing academic education or professional training in the areas related to the workplace but also increasingly popular lifelong learning, especially in the field of ICT. The use of ICT offers the possibility of innovative methods of teaching and learning, using publicly available services, and professional collaboration worldwide. ICT Competency as a form of lifelong learning includes safe and convenient use of ICT in work, leisure and communication. This technology allows the use of the Internet, digital content, electronic media, personal computers, mobile phones, electronic ATM, electronic books, digital television, etc. ICT Competency is associated with logical and critical thinking with highly developed skills of information management and advanced communication skills. Due to the rapid technological development, well-planned and quality training is essential primarily of employees of public institutions, and then the user to be able to understand, apply and use new technological solutions. An example of this is e-Administration, which necessarily involves the use of information technology to increase the availability and facilitate the execution of public services for the benefit of citizens, business owners and employees in these services.",2015,,,222,231

Where do we begin to instill a sense of self-directed learning that leads to a lifelong pursuit of knowledge and, more importantly, how? The aim of our study was to determine the influence of providing guided support in the use of social media to a group of future English as a Foreign Language, (EFL) teachers in Chile. In this context, traditional teaching practices and cultural norms, not to mention resistance to technology adoption often stand in the way of learner agency and evolving self-directed learner identities. We focussed on pre-service teachers as a strategic step in changing these trajectories. Our results provide powerful evidence of change in this group of emerging teachers not only in increased responsibility for learning but in a metacognitive awareness of 'how' to learn - key ingredients in reaching personal and professional potential. We conclude that technology needs to be re-conceptualized as not only an information provider but as a key player in constructing self-directed, lifelong learners.",2017,,,1371,1380
